PlantBasedDiet,I'm having so many health problems from this diet," **Warning, long post ahead** Okay so I had a heart attack in 2020. I have constant angina every day. I'm desperate to find a diet to alleviate my pain if its possible, especially since I'm looking at open heart surgery. I decided to give this plant based lifestyle a chance 6 months ago of eating nothing but whole plant foods and cutting out all the junk even though I was already vegan for a year, I was still eating bad. 
I try to do a Dr esselstyn style diet. High carb/low fat. Lots of starch, fruits, veggies and potatoes with some nuts. 
I did 80-10-10 in the past as well..  i decided to make a post listing all of the problems I'm having on this diet and asking you all if it's worth it at this point. I'm really considering giving this lifestyle up. 

Bathroom habits- So the first problem is the awful diarrhea and constipation I have from this. I'm either so backed up I don't go for days and when I finally do it's like a giant rope shit coming out or as soon as I wake up and take a sip of water My intestines violently contract and I have to run to the bathroom to poop out boulders of plant matter. It doesn't feel like a normal bowel movement. It feels completely unnatural and uncomfortable..

Digestion- this is another big one. My digestion is absolutely wrecked. When I eat these big meals packed with rice, veggies, potatoes ect. It feels like all of the fiber makes them impossible to digest and so they literally just on my stomach like a brick for hours without moving and give me horrible stomach aches so bad. 

Blood sugar problems? - so obviously eating high carb means a lot of fruit and starch. I noticed I am drinking stupid amounts of water daily now to quench My thrist and peeing 7 times a day like a pregnant woman. I even wake up in the middle of the night to pee twice because I can't stop. I'm also getting really dry skin and brain fog. My vision has started to blur with this and I can't read or focus on My phone. I haven't been to a dr yet but these are all signs of diabetes..

Electrolyte imbalances- I guess this comes from my diarrhea issue in part. It feels like everything I eat passing through Me is not good for holding on to salt and fluid. I've been getting very dizzy and light headed frequently now  like I'm chronically dehydrated and crave salt so bad. There are times I go into the kitchen and have to take a tea spoon of salt and eat it just to stop mtself from getting so weak or almost fainting. I also have heart arrhythmias and skips or flutters when this happens. 

Low mood/low libido/ low energy- these all kind of tie together. My mood is absolutely shit and in the gutter now, my energy is non existing and I feel like I can just lay on the couch all day because I'm so lethargic, my libido is dead. I never think about sex anymore. If I had a girlfriend she would definitely leave me. 

Extreme unintentional weight loss- there's really no calories in whole plant foods. I've been dropping unhealthy amounts of weight and muscle since eating this way and i can smash bowls of black beans, lentils and chick peas for calories but it never helps me gain any weight back. I'm already a skinny guy at 150 lbs, I'm now down to 140 lbs and can't gain and ounce of weight back because it seems impossible to get in enough calories per day to do that eating huge bowls of food. 


These are just the main problems I'm having with this diet. There's other side effects like weak teeth, poor sleep, anxiety... If someone has any remedies or ways to convince Me to make it work ill happily listen but its done nothing but damage My body and make me even more sick. I've tried so many different variations of eating this way in 6 months and nothing seems to work.. thanks",1652222200

PlantBasedDiet,8+ year vegan: I'm tired all the time,"My current diet patterns:
- no calorie counting
- breakfasts are commonly oatmeal or smoothie bowl
- lunch varies, could be apple with a LOT of peanut butter, or beans and rice. Or leftover dinner.
- dinner is often a hearty soup, or tofu with potato and vegetable 
- I snack on random things if they are available, from olives, chips, chocolate, fruits, etc
- I binge eat like 1-3x/week
- I just pickled a bunch of vegetables and oh my god I'm so excited to eat them in a few days

Other potential factors:
- I get 6-8 hours of sleep most nights
- I can't work out for a month because of surgery 2 weeks ago
- I walk a lot on some days and barely move on others.
- I stopped doing drugs and drinking 8 months ago
- I take a lot of vitamins, decided to stop taking iron because of constipation
- I have ADHD and depression
- I see a therapist once a month and I go out of my way to socialize 2-5x/week. 
- I tried intermittent fasting for a month like a month ago and my poop and farts are still remarkably bad since I tried IF.

I really don't like the idea of eating animals but I am starting to wonder if it would be healthy to mix into my current plant based diet. I eat plenty of carbs, fat, protein, and fiber, I'm not really sure what to do.

I see a lot of newer vegans thriving and that makes me happy, but it's hard to find 10-20+ year vegans and observe how they thrive. I care a lot about my health, and reducing the amount of harm I inflict on the world.",1652114561

I eat around like 80% Whole Foods, and I eat a lot, and a lot of calories. I even tried to add processed breads…. But there’s on problem… I can’t seem to gain weight. I’m eating a lot of calories and lots of fat and carbs and protein  and large portions… I have 3 meals and a smoothie usually. I try to make each meal atleast 700 calories, eating stuff like hemp seeds, avocados, whole cans of beans, nuts, coconut yogurt, whole grain bread, lentils, coconut oil…. but I seriously cannot gain any weight, my excercise is mostly walking, it’s moderate, not intense. I’ve tried all the foods, the oily bean soups, the pasta, even fried/junk foods like falafels and vegan chicken nuggets etc. is this a problem? I mean I feel like I’m losing like half a pound daily… Am I STILL not getting enough calories? Could my intake fiber just be pushing the food out and not absorb it?

PlantBasedDiet,Struggling to go 100% whole foods,"I'm switching from a regular vegan diet to a whole foods or mostly whole foods vegan diet. 

Until I started making the switch, I was eating some processed foods every day. Not a ton, but there was something processed in most of my meals.

I tried giving up: foods made with flour, oils, refined sugar, and processed ""junk food"" (like potato chips). I ate a lot of raw fruits and vegetables, nuts, and cooked grains. 

I did not give up tofu, tempeh, and meat substitutes that don't contain refined sugar. I kept eating things like peanut butter and sauces provided the ingredients were just whole foods, avoiding refined sugar and preservatives.

I felt incredible for the first 10 days. Then my body started to kind of get tired of it. I craved bread because it's easy to digest and full of those artificially added nutrients. So I gave in and had a little bread, and then some vegan ice cream! 

I'm not trying to be a purist about WF. I just want to get healthier.

PlantBasedDiet,It’s super easy to get enough protein lol,"I’ve been eating this way now for about 3 weeks now. 

Since changing to this lifestyle I have noticed significant changes to how I feel and how much energy I have now!

A big concern of mine was getting enough protein because being someone who is predisposed to depression, getting enough amino acids is crucial to building neurotransmitters for mental health.

I have been tracking my protein intake with the goal of getting about 70-100g of protein a day. 

Having been on different diets and being able to build strength and muscle on as low as 50g a day, I figure that’s a good range for me. 

However, I have been plugging the foods I’ve been eating into Cronometer and have been SHOCKED at how much protein I have been getting eating about 1500-2000 calories a day!

Most of the time without even thinking, I’m at 80-90g of protein but mostly, I stay above 100. 

Protein IS important but not at the expense of all the vast micronutrients we need for optimum health.

I feel I am successful because I eat lots of BEANS, Legumes, tofu, edamame, high protein vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, and oats. 

Tonight I’m making stuffed peppers with lentils and mushrooms and I CANNOT WAIT!!

Plants have so much protein and it’s often much cheaper than animal protein too and stuff like canned beans lasts forever. I love this new way of eating. 

Now to get more greens in my diet 😂",1651609818

PlantBasedDiet,What are your favourite high protein meals? (25g approx),"I'm transitioning to WFPB diet and am learning a lot about plant based sources of protein.  I do a lot of weight and endurance training and I'm quite a big woman so I'm aiming to get 100g protein daily (at the lower end of what's recommended for athletes).  I tend to meal prep at the start of the week for 4 days of work and then wing it a bit more at the weekend. Last week, I made a lentil and rice curry, bean and quinoa chili and then porridge with soya milk, berries, nuts and flaxseed for breakfast.  I struggled with the volume of food and couldn't quite finish lunch and dinner at the time. However, when I inputted into cronometer (as if I'd eaten the full portion), I still would only have eaten less than 1500 calories with 65g protein which is too little for someone my size.

So this week, I've been looking for some recipes that have larger amounts of protein but not massive volume, mainly lunch and dinners.  I have found some red lentil pasta that I can use and I'm going to experiment with tofu.  I've tried using tempeh before but never made it palatable.

I love it that way, but now I just had a meter of my small bowel removed and I can't really keep this dietary pattern up for the next month or so.

I have to limit my fiber intake to avoid diarrhea and dehydration (used to go over 100g/day pretty often), and right now I can't stand eating warm food, it gives me nausea. Also I have to rest and can't be active for hours in the kitchen, and I have lost appetite for large quantities.

All of this makes me think it's probably okay to introduce some more processed foods back into the mix to lower fiber while keeping calories high (could easily go underweight) until I'm better, but I'd like to hear some ideas for suitable meals that are still whole foods, I already know I'm gonna make some smoothies and overnight oats but other than that I'm not sure.

PlantBasedDiet,Vegan-Based Diet Linked to Fewer Rheumatoid Arthritis (auto-immune) Symptoms," A new study of women suggests that adopting a low-fat vegan diet and then eliminating remaining trigger foods may dramatically reduce symptoms of [rheumatoid arthritis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331715-overview) (RA) within months. After 16 weeks, the mean Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) decreased from 4.5 to 2.5 (*P* &lt; .001), and the mean number of swollen joints dipped from 7.0 to 3.3 (*P* = .03).

The study was published in the [American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15598276221081819). It's not clear whether the vegan diet or the restriction of trigger foods – or both or neither – was helpful. Significant weight loss in the diet group could have played a role in reducing symptoms.

Still, the dietary strategy is ""a life-changing experience for people,"" lead author Neal D. Barnard, MD, an internal medicine specialist and adjunct professor of medicine at George Washington University, Washington, D.C, and president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said in an interview. ""Doctors should know about it, and they should try it themselves.""

But no matter how many times I try to keep up with proper eating on a plant based diet….I always fail…: always get so drained I end up cheating and eating non plant foods and I get my energy back… but I don’t want to keep doing that.
I don’t know what else to do. I’ve tried using peanut butter , olive oil, avocado… and It never feels like I recover enough to keep training.

Could someone give me some guidance? Im just never able to eat enough and don’t have calorie condensed food to keep this up.

Please. Seriously please. I really need help. My family has a history of cancer and I need to stay away from meat according to my doctor . But I keep leaning on it.

PlantBasedDiet,My Noir Journey to the Heart of Huel,"I debated even jotting these thoughts down. 

The last thing this town needs is another lowlife hack sharing his sob-story of how he got started on Huel. I guess there’s a thousand ways to get hooked. As P.T. Barnum said, there’s a sucker born every minute. 

I was living in a grimy little studio on 56th and Main in East Manhattan. The ol’ lady and I had been down on our luck. I’d done a lot of living in the past year, and it showed. Not just in my permanent snarl, but in my waistline. I was desperate. Those days, everything was heavy. My eyelids. My ambitions. My heart. And in she walks, saying she had the answer. Now, bear in mind this ain’t no alleycat broad, we’re talkin’. This was my wife. 

“It’s this new diet fad,” she says. “A little like a protein shake. It’s called ‘Huel.’”

Huel. 

All the well to do from Montauk point to Malibu swear by the stuff. It’s known by some as the lifeblood of tinsel town. Said to take years of the face and inches off the waistline.

“That stuff is too good to be true,” I said, taking out my straight cutter and guillotining the end of my cigar. “I need Huel like I need a hole in the head.”

My baby strikes a match and lights me up. Taking a couple of tumblers from the mini-bar, she pours me a stiff bourbon and asks me to reconsider.

“Haven’t we suffered enough?” she asks. “What would you give for some *relief?*”

I watch the smoke curl through the air and waft out my balcony window. The traffic from the street below carries like the death rattle of civilization, writ large. So much for “The City that Never Sleeps.” Sleeping is the one thing I long for, and the one thing I can never have.

But still, the liquor is doing its work and helping me come ‘round to my gal’s idea.

“Alright, doll face,” I say. “If it’ll make you happy.”

We took a cab to the south side. The light stained the skyline, mirrored in a thousand surfaces in the cold glint of the New York rain. It was cold, and I pulled my double-breasted rain jacket tight around my shoulders. My bride shivered beside me on the cabbie’s vinyl seat. She hadn’t thought to bring a coat of her own. She has more beauty than sense, so I shrugged the thing off and gave it to her.

It was eighteen blocks, I’d say, to the parking garage where we met the Huel-slinger. I was no stranger to the dark underbelly of a city like this, and I had no illusions about what happened to guys like me after the sun went down. I asked my girl to wait while I talked mano-y-mano to the man engaged in the second-oldest profession. 

I slipped the taxi-driver a Jackson to keep the car idling and made my way to the shadowy figure in a trench coat.

“Cold night to be coatless,” he says, eying me like I’d already done him wrong.

“Ah, the cold never bothered me,” I said, swatting the air. “You got the Huel?”

He loosened the cinch around his coat and let me see underneath. A bottle of 1.5 KGs of Huel Black. The good stuff. I reached for it, but he swatted my hand away.

“Ah, ah, ah,” he said, copping a devious smile. “That’ll be 85 smackers.”

I pulled out my billfold and handed over the dough. 

“I know it comes with a free t-shirt and a shaker bottle,” I snarled. “I’m getting’ older by the minute and I got nothin’ to prove. Don’t cheat me.”

He procured the goods and I made my way back to the cab. My head was on a swivel, but I didn’t see any Fuzz. We made our way back to the apartment in our tin can, my feet buzzing on the floorboards as we rattled across the pockmarked streets of the Big Apple.

We’d made it inside the door, when my girl couldn’t wait any longer. She tore loose the plastic wrapping and shoveled some Huel into a shaker.

“I’m ready,” she exclaimed. “Let’s do it. *Now.*”

I’m a man of inordinate control, but when I saw how she handled that shaker with reckless abandon, I was persuaded to do the same. I grabbed the shaker once she had dosed and took a few big swigs myself, washing them down with my favorite brandy.

“Guess we’ll find out what’s next, Angel,” I said.

We were lost in the swirl of the brandy and Huel. With each sip, we knew we’d drank too much. But still, our inhibitions lowered, lowered, lowered. Dropping like a hooker’s panties in the red light district. Our ability to fight the Huel’s siren song became nonexistent. Down we went, reveling all the way.

It was quarter of 12 when I came to. I don’t know how much I’d had, but white powder littered the carpet of our studio, looking prettier than cocaine. I had the feeling I was still cresting, when the stuff hit my lower gut. It was like a one-two punch in the kisser, but it rearranged my guts.

“Honey, do you feel that?” I called out, the room spinning.

“Yeah, I—” my baby started. If she ever finished the sentence, I didn’t hear it. I was feeling the weight of the Huel as it slid into my duodenum. Lower it crawled, forming into clots and joining up with the other clumps of this infernal concoction. The stuff was slithering down my intestines now, hell bent on reaching my rectum. 

That’s when the spasms started. It began as a warm tingling in my sphincter, but quickly progressed into the core of my being. I felt my anal glands swell and sing, hoping for a piece of that action. The Huel was happy to oblige, coming first in waves of euphoria but then spurts of white-hot lava, burning down my anal cavity. Pulsating, pulsating, the stuff continued. The apartment was stripped away. New York was stirpped away. The earth and the sun and the stars became immaterial and time and space gave way to this sensation. All rational thought no longer had feeling. Just the warm, ever-present pulsating as the Huel squirt out my behind and down my leg. 

I don’t know how long I sat there, covered in my own mire like a pig before its slaughter. All I know is that when I awoke, there was standing water an inch deep. Water, I say, but was it feces? Was it Huel? Was there really any difference?

I don’t know, but I know I’ll never touch the stuff again.",1651024192

PlantBasedDiet,Need your suggestions on additional variants/flavors we I should introduce to the market,"Hi, I’m Rym. I founded a company called MiiRO that offers plant-based, no-added-sugar chocolates and baking goodies, that contain less than a teaspoon of sugar for a whole bag/bar. Each product is made with natural ingredients and sweeteners. I’m proud that we managed to totally remove any form of aftertaste unlike our competitors. Our mission is to convince people that plant-based and no added sugar alternatives can taste even better that the conventional products in order to gently support them switch to a healthier and happier life.  
Despite our products also attract people following keto and vegan diets, 80% of our customers follow none of those diets. They are health conscious individuals wanting products that satisfy their cravings without any negative impact on their body nor the environment. I know the Reddit community always gives honest and constructive feedback, based on their experiences and preferences. We now need your opinion as we’re scaling up. Based on the information shared above, which flavors and/or new products should we introduce to our range, that can be appealing to most people? For chocolates, we currently have White Chocolate Bar with Crispy Almonds Pieces, Peanut Butter Chocolate Bar, and Peanut Butter Cups. For baking products, we have Dark Chocolate Baking Chips, Peanut Butter Baking Chips, and Sugar-Free Maple Flavored Syrup.",1651012182

PlantBasedDiet,Are American split peas that low in protein ? Or does Cronometer have erroneous data ?,"Hi all ! I recently started again logging all my intakes into cronometer to monitor my situation.

First thing I noticed is I consume way too much fat, like 120% of the recommendation for my age and activity, and wayyy too few proteins. I'm barely reaching 50% of the recommended amount.

But today I compared the NCCDB protein values for green split peas (along with other stuff I have lying around, just to be sure values are matching) and the discrepancy is huge. Cronometer says 100g of split peas yields 8g of protein, whereas my split peas package says 22g for the same weight.

So now I'm in doubt. Is Cronometer telling me I'm lacking when I'm not ? Or perhaps are American split peas less protein-rich than european ones ? I'd rather not have to compare values with every single thing I ate in the last weeks but I'm not sure how to correct the values in Cronometer either.

I'd greatly value any input from people used to the app !

TIA and have a nice day !",1650972344
PlantBasedDiet,I threw away the pizza.,"TW: ED. Sorry for the long posting into the Reddit void. I’m wanting to restart WFPB diet and need a little celebration and support.

A year ago I did WFPB and felt amazing. I stopped, mostly out of not seeing results and being exhausted as a new FT working mom, I slipped into old habits. 

I have a painful history with food and body image. Somehow my parents couldn’t figure out how “finish your plate” coincided with “You’re too big for a two piece” as a child, but I digress. 

After being prescribed blood pressure medicine, for the first time in my adult life, a doctor gave me actual actionable advice beyond just “diet and exercise.” She led me to Forks over Knives and Gamechangers. 

I was hyped, I had already led a mostly vegetarian but processed food diet so the transition wasn’t too hard.  After a month of committing to wfpb and strength training, I had only lost 4lbs, so I gave up. Unbeknownst to me, I had Hashimotos which is a thyroid condition that makes it very difficult to lose weight as well as a large cancerous node exploding on my thyroid. 

Fast forward to today, I’m at a work conference for the week and I hate every single picture of me taken by my coworkers. It was really depressing because I had dressed up and felt like I looked nice but you know, hair and makeup don’t really change your size. So we went out to dinner, I drank and ate too much. I boxed up leftovers to take to my room, where I thought I’ll just save them for breakfast. But the more I laid in bed reflecting on how much I hated feeling like the literal elephant in the room, I decided I had enough. The story of “don’t let food go to waste” and “I’ll eat better after this meal” is so tired. I’m tired, literally from moving my body but also from thinking - can I fit behind this row of people, I hope this chair doesn’t break from under me, is that a glance of pity or fascination? For reference I’m nearing 300lbs. 

Now that we’re on day two I have a pretty good read on the menu for the week and planning accordingly. I have never ever thrown away a whole box of food, especially the best food in the world - pizza. But I’m done living with these painful accommodations as a fat person. Now that I’ve had thyroidectomy surgery and hopefully getting metabolism back on track, I think I will have a better response from my wfpb switch. 

If you made it this far, thank you for coming to my Ted talk. I would love to know your favorite go-tos, as my husband and I work demanding jobs with a small demanding toddler. :)",1650962440
PlantBasedDiet,How often would I have to eat to meat to keep being able to eat it without getting sick?,"I was vegan for around ten years before.  In the end I had to quit and eat meat for a while for a number of reasons.  


I wasn't easy to go back on a meat eating diet, the first piece of fish I ate made me throw up and I felt a bit nauseous for months while my body readjusted.    


The reasons that made me quit being vegan (mainly anemia and extreme poverty) have been dealt with and I have returned to a plant based diet.  However, I lead a fairly adventures life and would prefer to keep the ability to eat meat should the need arise.    


I have been looking for the answer on Google and haven't found it so I wondered if anyone here knew what the minimum amount of meat I could eat was to keep my system from rejecting it.",1650956100

PlantBasedDiet,How come you can't buy large bags of frozen raspberries anymore?,"If the time frame is helpful at all, I'm 25 and didn't start to really care for/cook for myself until I moved out of my parents' house two years ago. At that time (\~August 2020), I could go to target and occasionally get a large bag of frozen raspberries-- same size as any of the other large, bulk fruit bags like strawberry, blueberry, etc for $10. It was a bit hit or miss because they seemed pretty popular and would sell out quickly, but they were there. Fast forward less than a year. Since about February 2021, I can only find small bags for about $4 or $5. I still look every time because they're my favorite, even though I'm sure they aren't going to suddenly reappear anytime soon. But what gives?! I originally thought it was supply chain issues with covid since they were affecting damn near every industry, but it's been so long that I'm beginning to doubt that. I could write a love letter to raspberries. They're my favorite thing in the world and I just want my bulk frozen bags back haha.

Many that are just starting out don't realise yet how physically strong and energised you will feel. My skin changed within a matter of weeks when I adopted this diet, my hair became shinier, and I found it so easy to take up strength training and endurance sports.  


People often ask why I'm so healthy, and what I'm missing out on. But the thing is I get to eat all of my favorite foods every day. I can eat nice-cream made out of bananas, dates, and almond milk and still have toned abs. I can have plant-based tacos and eat anything I like without ever restricting anything, and never feel guilt.  


I also feel like when you've been plant-based for so long, your body doesn't even want/need other processed foods. The other day I tried a cheescake my mum made because even though my diet is 99% unprocessed and organic, I don't like to restrict. And I literally got food poisoning from the sugar and the fats my body wasn't used to.  


It just shows how plant-based foods nourish and heal you, while the standard western diet destroys you from within.

I am a transplant from the keto camp!

😎 newly here pretty much because I was becoming a problem drinker and I noticed that keto / low carb eating was causing alcohol cravings along with an unhealthy amount of diet soda.

I have been eating plant based recently because of a gout flare up and just wanting to see what the fuss was about. So far I have loved it and I feel like the damn energized bunny only a week in😂

Another thing I like about this diet is just how CHEAP it is. Seriously. Meat is expensive and it’s so nice to not have to center my diet around that anymore. Now 

Having gone to the grocery store and seeing how much animal products populate it, I can see the agenda behind pushing them. There’s too much money at stake.

However, with plant based, what is the REAL agenda? Everybody seems super healthy, reverses their disease and a lot of people here I have noticed are also low carb converts.

PlantBasedDiet,Kiwi in smoothies - harshly acidic,"Hi all,

Hoping for some suggestions please.  

I've been following the Fibre Fueled meal planner for a couple of months now, but the breakfast smoothie has always been a struggle for me.

There is a harsh aftertaste that I couldn't place.  I've just made the recipe and actually tasted each ingredient as it went in - both as whole food, and also after blending with a stick blender.

Turns out, the harsh taste was blended Kiwi - whole kiwi is fine. Strange but ok.

Can anyone suggest things I can add to this smoothie to smooth it out?  Recipe below:

1 Tbsp Hemp Seeds

1/2 Cup spinach

1 Kiwi

5 strawberries

2 tbsp peanut butter

1/2 banana

1 cup almond milk

&amp;#x200B;

I also added 1/2 tbsp of ground flaxseed to their recipe, and I'm thinking of adding 2 dates instead of the recommended optional sweetener. Happy to add more items to the list in general to make this a super-breakfast smoothie, but I have to control this acid harshness otherwise I just won't want to keep making it.

Or, I guess, I can just replace the kiwi with an apple or something?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks :)",1650464482

PlantBasedDiet,Vegan for 7 years but now struggling to nourish myself,"I went vegan 7 years ago when I was 15. While my family (non-vegan) did help me a lot with this, I became fairly self sufficient as I got older. 

I’m no longer living at home since I moved out for school, but I have found myself really struggling to make nutritious meals the past few months. I think that Ive been more stressed out this semester than ever before and also believe that my seasonal depression is to blame. I don’t have any energy or desire to make myself food. Thinking about the entire process of getting everything prepped, cooking it, then eating for 10mins only to have to clean everything back up again is agony. I also got back on my meds which I know affect my appetite (although not to the point where I can’t eat at all). I basically just snack throughout the day and eat nothing of nutritional value :/ My hair has been falling out and I am exhausted everyday regardless of how much I sleep. 

I want to feel alive again. I used to love cooking, but I just haven’t been able to get myself to do it. I’m also getting scared of buying any produce when shopping because I haven’t been using it like I used to so it just becomes wasteful. Any suggestions on how to get through this would be greatly appreciated.",1650424726

PlantBasedDiet,30-40 plant challenge!,"So, I recently found out that there's this challenge to include at least 30-40 different plants (including nuts, legumes, seeds, and grains) per week. Just out of curiosity, I started keeping track on Sunday, and...I'm already well over 40!

My secret is to make multigrain 'rice' (from 11 different grains, if you count different colors of quinoa and rice separately), mixed-nut milk (from 8 different nuts), and oatcakes+hummus from oats, 6 different seeds, and mungo beans (I also add tahini to my hummus, but I count it as part of sesame seeds for this purpose). So, my *baseline* is 27 different plant foods, right off the bat. Add in the fact that we usually use 3-5 different types of legumes every week (toor dal is a staple, but we sneak in black-eyed peas, mung beans, mung dal (which I count as the same as mung beans for this purpose), and occasionally kidney beans. cannellini beans, chickpeas, or a mix of 3 different lentils) and we pick up tons of different veggies, and hitting 30 is almost trivial (and 40 is relatively easy with a bit of planning).

Does anyone else think this challenge is too easy?",1650388032

PlantBasedDiet,Keeping the fridge full,"So I got a comment over the weekend about my bare fridge and I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong. I am a working single mom adopt more WFPB into our diet.

My fridge is always on the sparse side but my freezer and pantry is well stocked with frozen  fruit/veg and dry goods. 

Breakfast is mostly waffles, musli or oatmeal I mixed in some frozen fruit. Lunch is typically leftovers, chickpea tuna or fruit, snack bars 

I meal plan but mostly dinners (I cook 4-5 nights a week depending if my son is home) and most dinners. Because of work I rely heavily on my IP to dump and go. 

This weeks menu -spaghetti w/salad, Greek pasta salad w/homemade rolls, tiki masala, and a Mediterranean soup.

I always see these these vloggers with these bountiful fridges overflowing with produce. 

I am working on getting away from baggies premixed salad twice a week and making my own, I typically get my greens from the freezer to mix into meals. I buy as needed so if a recipe only need 2 cucumbers that’s all I will buy. We don’t eat much processed food outside of the silk yogurt and tofu. The produce that we eat most often are on the counter

So my fridge has OJ water, condiments, couple yogurts, strawberries, handful celery/ carrots in a water container, tahini, pickles, a container of chickpea tuna. A bin of wilted veggies that need to be eaten, veggie broth, tomato paste, tofu block, mushrooms and a container of butter, flaxseed.

I used to buy hummus but the kids don’t like it so I just make my own when I’m in a mood same with milk (as needed vitamix)

My bloodwork is fine and we are healthy weight. Is it weird to have a very minimalist fridge I feel sometimes like I’m not doing enough.",1650374151

- I've been vegan for 8+ years.
- My diet is a majority whole foods. 
-- protein rich foods (tofu, chickpeas, black beans, lentils, nut butter, brown rice, red lentil pasta)
-- vegetables (leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, carrots, celery, etc)
-- fruits (apples and bananas)
-- calorie dense homemade sauces (cashew based creamy sauces and dressings mostly)
- I avoid (but do not exclude) empty carbs (bread, pasta) and sugar (candy, sweets, pastries, etc).
- I take a ton of vitamins and I just got my blood work done. Getting all the nutrients I need.
- Got into intermittent fasting (16:8) a month ago to stop late night emotional eating. 

Exercise:

- hour of yoga 4-5x a week
- a little strength training at the gym about 2-3x a week.


The problem:

My farts still smell awful and I'm constipated. I only poop like once a week. I eat a lot of food and I don't count calories. I've actually gained like 5lbs since starting to intermittent fast.

I'm about to do a cardio video to see if that's something that will help me poop. I'm used to pooping 2x a day and I sincerely think I've gained like 2-4 lbs of poop in my body.

PlantBasedDiet,Another newbie,"Hey y’all !

Sorry if you get this a lot on this sub. But I’m considering plant based diet and, as a potential newbie, I guess my two main concerns are:

But how you get carbs? How you get protein?

My first thought for carbs is whole wheat bread (wait not sure if thats plant based technically). Maybe potatoes actually, that sounds better. I think potatoes have some protein too actually. 

For protein, maybe there are high protein veggies I can make sure I eat a lot of. And of course beans and lentils (and chickpeas or other legumes maybe too).

Mainly I would do this for my GI health, up my fiber intake and micronutrients. I overall want to be healthier but again my concern are carbs and protein and maybe other nutrients I might lose by going plant based. 

Obviously I want the plant based food to still taste good too, but I bet I could find some good recipes once I know what plants I should stick to to get carbs and protein (and other nutrients), if that’s possible.",1649380867
PlantBasedDiet,Gastrointestinal Distress from this way of eating?,"I had been following this way of eating for about three weeks (mostly done with the transition off dairy products). Then one day two weeks ago, I slowly began to feel terrible stomach cramps. I thought it was period cramps, but it was so much worse. I was nauseous and not eliminating. I was afraid to eat. At one point, it was so bad I just laid in the tub sobbing because I couldn’t manage the pain. I tried Biofreeze, pain meds, a hot shower, and heating pads - nothing seemed to help. It took about three days before the pain began to subside. Admittedly, I took a couple of hits of weed to relax enough to try to go to the restroom, and it seemed to work (I don’t normally smoke and it wasn’t enough to even feel high). My insides (whole digestive tract) felt sore for days afterwards. 

Since this happened, I have been too nervous to go back to this way of eating 100%. I went to the doctor and got an X-ray, but it revealed nothing. The doctor doesn’t seem to be concerned, but the pain was the worst of my life and I’m just afraid of suffering again. 

Before this diet, I was keto for several years. Before that, it was a standard American diet. I have never eaten a vegetable and bean-forward diet before now, and probably never a high fiber diet. So of course, this could be completely unrelated to this way of eating, but my brain is attaching them anyway.

I’ve been a junk food vegan for a long time, and decided that it was time to take my health more seriously. I started wfpb two weeks ago, and I’ve been enjoying the change. I don’t even miss the oils and fats. I’ve been monitoring my weight and lost 3 lbs in the past two weeks, which I’m very excited about as I’m about 10 lbs  overweight. I’m very hopeful that my cholesterol is moving down in the right direction.

I’ve noticed this enthusiasm is not really shared by my friends and loved ones. I’ve told two close family members about my experience so far, and the only thing they had to say was “ok but you need to treat yourself sometime.” It’s only been two weeks! I haven’t expressed any difficulty in eating wfpb or any desire to go back to my old ways, so I don’t understand why no one seems supportive?

PlantBasedDiet,Should I swap out my flax seeds and chia seeds for hemp seeds in order to increase my omega 6 and methionine intake?,"I follow a whole plant food vegan diet. while routinely combing over the details I only just noticed that while my omega 3 intake is typically 500%+ RDI, My omega 6 intake doesn’t even seem to reach 50% RDI daily. While a lot of information and promotion exists for Omega 3s I don’t see a lot of compelling reasons to increase omega 6 intake to a particular minimum. This is likely because most people get in way too many omega 6s vs omega 3 since omega 6s bioaccumulate more through farmed animal products that use lots of grains for feed. I also assume it is because the ratio of both omegas for optimal health is contested.

Secondly while I do get enough of the essential amino acid methionine within my 1,500 calories a day diet to survive I am not sure if it is enough to thrive athletically. This is cause I always seem to get juuuust enough methionine for living but not much more for additional abuse like I do the other aminos. This makes me feel like I need more methionine rich plant sources other then just my spinach.

The way I see it, hemp seeds are relatively rich in both omega 6 and methionine with an inconsequential reduction of omega 3s. This makes me feel like swapping out the flax and chia for hemp seeds would be a net positive. Problem is I just don’t know enough to say if this would actually make a notable difference.",1648817050

Don't worry if you've never cooked before. I'll be present the entire time, giving instructions and demonstrating how to prepare the dish. All you have to do is buy the ingredients (I'll provide the list ahead of time) and join the Google Meet room with your camera turned on or off on the agreed-upon date and hour. At the end of the class, there is also a QnA. After the class, you will receive the written recipe.

**Matar Tofu** (tofu and green peas in tomato onion gravy) and **Matar Pulao** are on the menu (Pilaf with peas). This combo is ideal for someone who is just starting out in the kitchen with Indian cuisine.

Details about the class,

**Date and time- 9th April, Sunday. 5 PM Eastern Time**

**Medium- Google Meet (link will be sent a few minutes before the class starts)**

**Duration- 1 hour 30 minutes approximately**

**Charge- 15 USD (via PayPal)**


You are welcome to go at my profile to get a sense of what to expect from the session.

PlantBasedDiet,I am no longer prediabetic!,"Hello Everybody! 

I just wanted to share a success story for anyone who may be suffering from some of the same things I have been. In short, I have had binge eating disorder (BED) for the past four years but it came increasingly bad within the past two years specifically. I would binge eat vegan junk food that was super high in saturated fat and would also binge a LOT on things like walnuts, almonds, etc. 

I began having classic diabetes symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, postprandial lethargy, and had acne breakouts all over my body. I had a FPG and it came back as me being pre-diabetic (over 100mg/dl) at the age of 20 and with a  BMI of 19.  Overall, I was in terrible health. 

I started taking medication for the binge eating which went down a lot in frequency but I was still eating a junky vegan diet and binged on nuts at least once or twice a week. My health was steadily declining. 

After coming across Dr. Greger's video series on insulin resistance and reversing type 2 diabetes I realized that I had these issues because I was eating far too much fat, mostly from the frequent binge episodes. For example, a typical binge for me I could eat up to 150g of fat within 30 minutes by eating cups of nuts or pints of vegan ice cream. 

I decided to fully commit to a wfpb diet a month ago and have been heavily restricting my fat intake to be between 20-30g a day (10-15% of kcal intake). All of my symptoms are GONE. I no longer have acne, polyuria or polydipsia, and I am never tired or feverish after eating.

I have an appointment with my PCP this week to get my blood drawn so hopefully my FPG will have gone down! I'm so excited to tell them how every issue I've been suffering with for years is now no longer existent all thanks to a diet change. 

Thank you so much to everyone in this subreddit for having active discussions. helping out others, and bringing awareness to the beauty of whole food plant-based nutrition because you all essentially saved my life.

PlantBasedDiet,My dad after following a low carb high animal fat and protein diet has had a horrible health scare and wake up call.,"Title. 

My dad isn’t even 50 he’s not obese used to be quite in shape he’s got a bit more fat than he used to but nothing that would scream unhealthy. 

I’m the polar opposite almost completely WF plant based east meat only occasionally it’s caused a bit of conflict like he got mad at me saying I must be dying of iron and protein deficiency (yes stupid I know). He always sent me videos of the quack Eric Berg about how eggs and red meat are healthy because they have the “good cholesterol that boosts testosterone” yada yada, he’ll eat 5 eggs a day yolk included and disgusting servings of red meat.

His blood test results have come back and it’s genuinely worrying his LDL cholesterol is over 200, as well as he has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and a moderate reduction in kidney function.

He came straight to me with the results, I’m not a doctor although I am studying to be one (fingers crossed) I communicated just how worrying the results are as well as cited study after study detailing just how much is impacted by his high meat diet. For the first time he didn’t challenge me I pulled out my blood results and compared it to his to show him just how fucked it is.

He had his doctors appointment just now, am honestly proud of our family GP the first thing he said to him was to cut out almost all if not all animal protein from his diet and eat a whole foods plant based diet + intermittent fasting. He even said a plant based diet is the only diet to reverse heart disease (God bless you Dr Esselstyn), told him the only way to make it to 60 would be to completely overhaul his diet.

I know maybe this post isn’t exactly appropriate but I wanted to write this out just to spread awareness about the misinformation and real life harm quacks in the low carb/keto community like Eric Berg spread and how it actually impacts real lives. I will keep you updated on his improvements I sincerely hope he goes through with the diet I think this health shock has really rattled him for the better.",1648190848

PlantBasedDiet,“Whole grain” foods…,"I recently watched an excellent video by Plant Chompers where he comes to the conclusion that “whole grain” labels on food are extremely misleading. This is something I have known to some extent but I didn’t realize how problematic the legal use of the term is.

In the U.S., almost all product labeled whole grain are composed of processed whole grains. These grains are separated into parts (bran, germ, etc.) then reconstituted into the product where it is then labeled “whole grain.” The main issue here being, that only 51% of this final product needs to whole grain. This means that up to 49% of the product can be white flour. When I learned this, it suddenly made sense why whole grain flour seems to have a near equal effect on blood sugar spikes compared to white flour.

As a lover of whole wheat flour, pasta, and many other whole grain products… I am super bummed. Is there something I am missing here? I am not an expert and would love more input. I am currently thinking of abandoning many of my whole grain grocery store staples and replacing them with ancient grains like kamut. Might even buy an electric mill.

PlantBasedDiet,"The ultimate vegan everyday-meal for the bulking, low-meat athlete on a time crunch: RAINBOW RISOTTO! 20 veggies, 6 beans, 3 whole grains, 45g protein, ONLY 1 MINUTE PREP TIME, READY IN 15M, AND SUPER EASY AND DELICIOUS!!","Eating healthy, delicious food doesn't have to be hard work!

For the past half a year, I've been eating this custom risotto recipe every day and I feel great! It's so much easier to bulk when feeding myself healthy food is thoughtlessly easy.

* I ordered every vegetable from harmony house foods (they ship bulk, dried veggies) and mixed them in a big plastic tub that lives on my counter (1 cup of each veggie, plus a little more mushrooms because I like 'em). 
* I also bulk buy their pre-cooked dried beans, which have a basically infinite shelf-life and cook in minutes instead of hours. Mix 'em in a separate tub since I sometimes use veggies and beans separately in other recipes (like veggying up my macncheese or ramen)
* Every day, I put some water in a pot, dump a half cup of my veggie blend in with half cup of beans, plus a full cup of parboiled rice+millet+quinoa. I squirt some olive oil, a 'poultry spice blend,' liquid amino, and soymilk in, set a 10m timer and go read/work/whatever while the water cooks down. 
* (Sometimes I'll put in a fake meat like mock-dock with everything else if I'm not going to drink a protein shake with this meal)
* I do baby sit it for the last 3-4 minutes after the timer rings. However long it takes to visibly turn into a risotto and not a soup.
* The whole ordeal takes under a minute to prepare, and it's an extremely forgiving recipe-- I just put fist-fulls of stuff in at this point and eyeball the water, no need to measure.

The best part is, I really don't get bored of it: The soymilk+poultry spice 'risotto' version is the default, but I'll often substitute with half a jar of store bought tika sauce, curry, or even a pasta sauce and it becomes completely different dishes with 0 extra effort.

PlantBasedDiet,Badly needing some help with higher protein and lower carb diet!,"I have always had an issue with getting enough protein, even before I went vegan. On average I eat between 20 and 50 grams. 

But for my weight, I need almost 100grams of protein.

I'm usually a junk food vegan, but this year I'm trying to become healthier. I've managed to boost my average up to around 40 - 60 grams a day but I'm still struggling.

For example, for breakfast I'll have:

Rolled oats with 200ml alpro protein soy milk, scoop of protein powder, tablespoon of peanut butter. And some seeds and ground Flax on top. That right there can get me close to 30grams of protein in the morning.

But it's for lunch and dinner I struggle most. I usually only have breakfast and dinner, then snacks. So trying to squeeze three meals in is difficult. And I'm struggling with making high protein but low carb meals.

...

I have PCOS resulting in some insulin resistance, and high protein low carb diets are recommended to help reverse this.

So, my current macro goals are: 1700 cals

35% protein (140grams)

35% fats (64grams)

30% carbs (125grams)

But...on average I'm only meeting around 40% of my protein goals. And going over my carb goals by double sometimes!

Once I can start meeting these goals, I aim to decrease carbs to 25% and increase protein to 40%. But right now I can't even meet my current goals.

...

I've tried including protein smoothies but I barely get any of it down. Still trying to work out recipes that I like.

PlantBasedDiet,Any experiences with the ProLon fast mimicking diet?,"Hi everyone

I recently watched this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP5-BYOvM10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP5-BYOvM10) and then watched Joel Kahn on Rich Roll, followed by Valter Longo on Rich Roll. 

I've never been interested in trying IF as a lifestyle, because I'm someone who generally wakes up hungry and my three big WFPB meals a day work just fine for me. I don't have any immediate concerns I'd like to address like weight loss or energy levels.

But I'm intruiged by these discussions on calorie restriciton and longevity - about how fasted states trigger autophagy and regenration etc. 

So from what I understand the ProLon diet is supposed to help you reap the long-term benefits of fasting without the 'pain' of fasting, so I'm considering giving it a go. Basically, for a 5-day period once every three months or so, you restrict your diet to 800 calories to trigger a fasted state. Before and after you eat normally. 

Has anyone tried anything like this? 

FWIW I wouldn't buy the kit, I'd make my own soups/bars etc",1647504250

PlantBasedDiet,Anecdote about my mental health benefits,"Hey all, I’m mostly a lurker but I’d like to write this message about the mental health benefits I have experienced on a (mostly) plant based diet in case it helps someone else!

I have struggled with depression, anxiety, dissociation, and general feelings of fear and paranoia for as long as I can remember. I always had an instinctual sense that what I put into my body has a direct impact on how I feel, so I started experimenting with “diets” pretty young. In my teens, I first fell into the trap of “healthy” packaged foods, and then I had an eating disorder. In my twenties, I tried keto several times, paleo, Whole 30, and having other arbitrary food restrictions. In between I had a more or less “healthy” average diet, with periods of bingeing on processed junk. I’ve never been overweight but I’ve always been skinny-fat. I’ve also always been really low energy, had tons of brain fog, had some skin and constipation symptoms, and generally just felt like I wasn’t living anywhere near my potential. 

About 6 months ago I decided to try a WFPB diet. I wasn’t perfect because I eat out a few times per week; I would very occasionally eat fried food, and even when I didn’t, I know that all restaurants cook with oil. I ate some processed foods like breads, but most of my diet was fruits, veggies, whole grains, beans/lentils, and some nuts. 

When I tell you I have never felt better in my *entire* life … I can’t even explain it. It was like a fog that had been present since memory had finally lifted. It was like I was finally myself. 

Then, a month ago, I started eating some fish and dairy and oil. Not every day, but I became lax. Toast with butter and an egg for breakfast some days, salmon for dinner other days. Potato chips for a snack, fries and a veggie burger with cheese when out to eat. Cooking a veggie stir fry with oil. Within a month of eating more lax I felt crazy again. It was like my dopamine receptors totally reverted to a state of desensitization and I felt out of control. I started scrolling social media more, I lacked motivation, I was sad and paranoid and unstable. 

This past week, I have gotten back to a WFPB diet. I’m not perfect about it and I may not ever be, but WOW does it make a huge difference for my mental health. Within a few days I felt that sense of clarity and incredible energy I lost during my month of eating more animal products and oils. I’m getting more done, I feel brighter and happier, and best of all, I feel like myself. 

I credit a lot of this change in me to the fact that fat consumption has more to do with hypoglycemia that sugar consumption does. I don’t have any studies to quote right now but they’re out there - basically the point is that fat fills the cells and prevents glucose from entering them, leading to a high level of glucose in the blood stream, which leads to blood sugar imbalances. Keto takes glucose out of the equation entirely, but doesn’t solve the problem. A low fat, high glucose diet does solve the problem, by allowing glucose to enter cells unencumbered by fat. Stabilized blood sugar means stabilized mood. 

Overall, I think there is a threshold for eating animal products for me. A bit of fish every couple of months may be okay, but animal products most days is not okay. I’m honestly just extremely happy that I’ve finally, after all these years, figured out a diet that makes me feel how I have always known I could feel. The research about the physical health benefits is just the cherry on top :)

My final words are that I want anyone reading this who is on the fence about a plant based diet and is struggling with poor mental health - PLEASE try it. I have tried medication, therapy, meditation, and physical activity, and they are all special and important parts of mental health, but I can tell you that NOTHING has changed my life the way that a WFPB diet has. It’s honestly astonishing.",1646458702
PlantBasedDiet,How to make something like puffed kamut myself...,"I have come to really enjoy eating puffed kamut at breakfast. Unfortunately, it's not available locally, so I have to order it online, and that can get expensive.

I went to look up how to do it, and nearly all the recipes seem to have oil, although the puffed kamut I buy doesn't have any oil.

PlantBasedDiet,Unexpected effect of cutting out animal products.,"I was told this question belongs here instead of r/vegan.🤷‍♀️

I'm so afraid I'm gonna jinx myself by posting here, but I really want some feedback on this.  
So I'm trying to eat beegan. For the past 3 weeks, I've been using up all my animal food products and only buying new vegan food products and meals. Ever since last Saturday, the only animal products I've been consuming are Honeycomb cereal and my remaining butter and non-vegan supplements (Vitamin D and hair, skin, and nail vitamins). I used up my Eggo waffles the day before that, my oysters earlier that week, and my eggs and sardines the week prior. So I'm about 3 weeks with no meat or poultry, a week with no eggs, and over a week with no fish.  
Now, one obvious change I've noticed but never expected: my hair is a lot less greasy! As long as I can remember, my hair has been so greasy, I need to wash it every day. I did try training it in 2020 by washing it less since I had nowhere to go, but it still felt too gross for me to bear, so I gave up.  
Well, 3 days ago, I decided screw it, I'd sleep for a few more minutes and just spend the day with my greasy hair, won't kill me... except, it didn't look half as bad as it usually does! I skipped it again this morning. Same thing. Not date night or job interview nice but not nearly as embarrassing as it should be.  
So am I imagining things, or could cutting out meat, (almost all) dairy, and eggs actually cause this? Nothing else that I'm aware of has changed.",1646419622
PlantBasedDiet,How bad is it to rarely meet Omega 6 RDA?,"I've spent the last few months putting together a diet that doesn't bother my IBS-D too much. I've settled on low-fat, high soluble fiber, low insoluble fiber with psyllium supplementation, which has gotten me down to only 3-4 toilet trips daily and allowed me to live a more normal life.

According to Cronometer, I'm meeting all nutritional targets except for Omega 6, of which I usually get about 8g daily, mostly from soy. Omega 3 is about 1.5g, mostly from soy and veg.

Is that bad? If so, what are some sources of omega 6 that are **low in insoluble fiber**?",1646415962

I had a big ol' jar of marinara sauce not being used so I cooked it up (well, heated it up, anyway) with a couple of cans of chickpeas. Tasted great!

I ended up serving it atop of some whole grain rigatoni noodles, but that was underwhelming. The noodles tasted too much like brown, ""whole wheat"" bread that I ate growing up, and I hate that stuff.

So now I'm looking for something else to do with this chickpea sauce besides noodles. Any suggestions? I'm probably not going to mix in rice, either. Unless someone can recommend a specific type of rice that they think would really sell it.

From what I’ve read, 

-	I soak them about 8 to 12 hours
-	Drain and rinse
-	Cover with a towel and wait 12 to 18 hours

On my first attempt, I soaked the beans 24 hours accidentally. I also covered the dish with a lid instead of a towel. I waited 24 or more hours. I could see a greyish film on the beans and no sprouts. Maybe it didn’t get enough air or I soaked them too long?

On my second attempt, I soaked them about 10 hours. I used a dish towel as a cover instead of the bowl lid. I again waited 24 or more hours. This time there wasn’t a grey film but there also weren’t sprouts. I put them back in water and little spots of mold grew on the water surface. 

Both times I used a CorningWare ceramic casserole dish instead of glass. Would that matter?

PlantBasedDiet,Challenging myself in March. Protein snack ideas?,"I've been meaning to start eating WFPB for years, but I haven't gotten around to it. I could blame a lot of things, but it mostly comes down to me being lazy and not used to cooking. I've been eating fully plant based since February 2017 I think, I honestly don't remember which year I started, but 4 years sounds about right.

I've recently been informed that I'm at an increased risk for some diseases and my bones have already taken a hit from my condition. The treatment I'm getting will probably help a lot with all of it, but it's time that I really start fixing the way I eat. I purchased a book sometime last year that I opened for the first time a week ago, and it got full meal plans and shopping lists for 4 weeks, so I've made the decision to try that for March.

The only thing I currently question is how I should do the mornings I've been at the gym, I would like to have a protein-y snack to take within 30 min after working out. The breakfasts I will eat about 1h-2h after, and while they sound like solid breakfasts, I would like some extra. I'm thinking of maybe having a small mix of nuts and seeds (maybe some blueberries too to freshen it up) with a chia pudding. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good after-workout snack or does that sound solid? It will add quite a bit of calories, but maybe that's fine since it's the days I work out.",1645426524

I've been doing this for close to a week now, and one great thing I noticed was that it has completely eradicated my big appetite. I thought that was impossible.

Probably because the food isnt very 'fun'/stimulating anymore and pretty bland, but Im slowly finding ways to make it tolerable. Im losing weight and Im very happy that I'm not super interested in eating much anymore, but I know that some days Im probably not getting in enough calories. I do have bananas and sos free almond butter I eat on some days when I feel like I need to add more, but I really just dont get hungry anymore, even when I know I couldn't have possibly eaten more than 500-700 calories that day.

I heard that mushrooms, specifically lions mane and oyster and a gang of others, help brain function immensely. I was skeptical, but I bought a mushroom complex supplement, 2600 mg, on amazon.

But no one asked! My stealth tactic was successful. 

What I did: 

- for our breakfasts we had (traditional German) bread rolls with spreads. I just put peanut and cashew butter and jelly and some cocoa nibs among other things on the table and ate those. We had oat milk with our coffee as even my husband prefers that. 

- for our main meal (lunch) I made stuffed veggies with rice and a salad. The veggies were filled with two things, either meat or a 'mediterranean' (as I stealthily called it) filling with mushrooms, chickpeas etc and breadcrumbs/cashew butter on top instead of cheese). Mediterranean diet is seen as something normal and good by my family, so this one was easy. The cookies I served with coffee afterwards were normal looking, but plant-based ones. And a plant based banana bread which our kid likes so it was for him mostly. 

- for our dinners we had (traditional German) bread with fixings. I had made some vegetable antipasti and hummus and served a tomato-basil spread (all normal enough) along with the 'traditional' fixings they had. Not even the smoked tofu raised any eyebrows.",1645009362

I have read a ton on plant based sources of protein and understand complete vs incomplete proteins. Others on different subs have said it's easy to get enough protein on plant based but I'm actually struggling quite a bit and feeling pretty run down. 

I was hoping you could take a look at what I'm eating and recommend ways to get additional protein.

Notes: I am sensitive to soy and wheat products so I need to limit these as much as possible. 

Breakfast: 
1/2 cup rolled oats, 1/2 cup almond milk, blueberries, chia seeds

Lunch: 
Option 1: 1 cup quinoa, red peppers, carrots with an olive oil and balsamic vinegar dressing

Option 2: 1 cup lentils, almonds, dried apricots, red onion, celery dressed in fresh orange juice, olive oil, apple cider vinegar

Dinner: 
Option 1: 1/2 cup chickpeas, eggplant, tomatoes, onions, red peppers with a side of quinoa

Option 2: corn or flour tortillas with 1/4 cup black beans, 1/4 sweet potato, half an avocado

We are both octogenarians and all about healthy aging.   Based on our own experiences, we do believe that switching to a WFPB diet 16 years ago has been a key factor in our feeling better than ever at 80+ years of age!  

We have more energy, can't remember the last time we were sick, and live every day with youthful vitality.  We look and feel like we get younger with each year that passes!

If our blood pressure gets above 140/90, you’re taken out of rotation and get clerical make-work duties until you can get it down below 140/90 again. Last checkup the doc took my bp, looked at the result, told me to lay down and relax for ten minutes or so and she’d take it again. That time I got 140/90, exactly. 

This was five months ago. Four months ago I started whole foods plant based eating, Partly because i figured it’d be better to prevent any complications than trying to medicate them after the fact. No cheat days, no added sugar, salt, or oil. A Daily Dozen-Mcdougall diet. 

Today I checked my blood pressure qt the pharmacy just to see if it was going in the right direction.

PlantBasedDiet,Low Oil vs (High) Teflon?,"We know free oil is bad for endothelial cells, but what is the cost benefit analysis compared to non-stick teflon cookware?

Polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE, commonly known as teflon is used to endow cookware with nonstick coatings.  Slightly above cooking temperatures, PTFE off-gasses fluorocarbons and free radicals.  Decomposition byproducts may or may not still be present below this temperature, at levels below the current detection limit.   These extremely low levels are particularly an issue for fluorocarbons, as they are highly efficient bioaccumulates. 


So, what is healthier, low oil, or oil free teflon cookware?

This is a real example: i prepare mujadara from 1 cup of raw lentils, 3/4 cup basmati rice (it is wfpb, deal with it), 2 med white onions.  I use (measured with a digital balance) &lt;1 g olive oil to coat the pan that I cook the onion in.  

So assuming this &lt;1g is a full 1g, and that there is 100% transfer to the onions,  this 1250 calorie meal follows and 80/17/3 (c/p/f) split.  The 1g of olive oil (9 calories) equates to about 0.7% of calories from free oil. 

So what is worse, &lt;1% of calories from free oil, or sub detectible amounts of fluorocarbons?",1644633094

PlantBasedDiet,Hunger and eating to satiety.,"Having some trouble with the diet. Starch solution isn't going as well as I had hoped. Potatoes fill me up initially but they leave me pretty hungry shortly thereafter. Fruit does the same. Pulses help slightly. Even adding in a giant salad of red cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, and greens alongside dinner doesn't do the trick. I have heard that a lot of people feel less hungry by adding in more fats, but I'm nervous about doing so because weight loss is allegedly HCLF and all the plant-based doctors say to minimize fat intake. (FWIW, I had already eaten several pounds of veggies throughout the day.)

Not sure what to do. Looking at some of the recipes from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine for inspiration, and they seem to be very calorically dilute. Do I just need to get used to being hungry all the time? The only time I don't feel hungry is when I eat animal protein, but this is allegedly keeping me overweight.",1643945616

Chemical constituents

Additionally, mulberry fruits hold a diversity of nutrient elements that play a vital function in human metabolism. M. alba fruit is a good resource of carbohydrate, lipid, protein, vitamins, minerals, and fibers. The quantity of protein in fresh M. alba fruit is greater than that of raspberries and strawberries and comparable to blackberries, whereas the anthocyanin content is higher than blackberry, blueberry, blackcurrant, and redcurrant. M. alba fruit contains both essential and non-essential amino acids. Essential amino acid /total amino acid ratio is 42 percent, which is almost equal to certain protein-rich foods such as fish and milk. Hence, can be considered as an excellent protein source.

The ascorbic acid content in M. alba and M. nigra is 15.81 and 12.81 mg/100g, respectively of fresh fruit weight. Mulberries also contain some important alkaloids that activate macrophages by stimulating the immune system and hence safe guard the human body against health threats. The most important alkaloids isolated from mulberry leaves are 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ),1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol, and 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol. Primary sugars present in mulberry are fructose and glucose, which increase with ripening. Amongst the widely recognised varieties, M. alba has the maximum fat content of 1.10% followed by M. nigra with0.95% and M. rubrawith0.85%. Oleic acid, palmitic acid and linolenic acid are the major fatty acids in mulberry fruit. The sequence of fatty acids in M. alba fruit is polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) followed by monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids. Among all fatty acids, PUFA is the main fatty acid in mulberry fruits comprising at least 76.68%, which is even higher than that of strawberries.

There are many organic acids present in mulberry fruits viz citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid and fumaric acid however, malic acid is primarily found organic acid in all the species. 

Mulberry is also an excellent source of some important minerals particularly calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and sodium. 

Calcium and potassium are the two most abundant elements, whereas sodium is present in less quantity.

Antinutritional components, includes fibre, cyanide and tan...................read more

Note : 

Pure and fresh mulberry fruit juice under cold storage environment remains fresh for a duration of three months and bottled juice can stay fresh at ambient temperature for a period of six months to a year. 

Leaves of mulberry are economically viable due to their important role in the sericulture industry since ancient times.

Mulberry is a multi-functional plant. Being an excellent source of nutrients and phytochemicals, mulberry has been established as functional food. Mulberry leaves are a precious source of macro- and micronutrients, and organic acids

The leaves are also cultivated for dairy animal feed due to the positive effect on milk production

Research : 

Different parts of Morus species like fruits, leaves, twigs, and bark exhibit strong anti-tyrosinase inhibition activity that makes it a suitable candidate in cosmetic industries as a whitening agent. Most Asian countries use M. alba (leaves, fruits, root bark and branches) as an ingredient in cosmetics

              - In a study, ethanolic extract of M. alba fruit was utilized to develop an emulsion-based cream to study its clinical effect on skin melanin, erythema, and moisture content for eight weeks. The formulated cream significantly decreased melanin content without causing any type of skin irritation

PlantBasedDiet,Becoming plant based has changed our lives forever,"And I couldn't be happier. When my family and I became plant based we were amazed with all the options and variety of foods, taste, and color. 

We are from Mexico so we thought we wouldn't  be able to survive without meat but no! 

We are so happy, another reason we became plant based was because of our religion. We are Seventh day adventist. SDA believes fully that God never intended for us to eat meat. Commandment 6 says ""thou shall not kill.""

Why would God contradict himself? He said no killing. People who eta meat are part of the problem even if they aren't the ones killing the innocent animals 🥺

But anyways, when I met my husband he was also transitioning from meat eater to plant based. 

We noticed we don't get angry easily, life is simpler. 

It's also cheaper! Meat was expensive but we spend that money on extra fruit now.

Yay for a plant based life 😍😍😍😍😍

That is all. 

Thanks!",1643426722

PlantBasedDiet,how to ask my baby girl’s adoptive family to raise her plant based for her health &amp; well being?,"we are naturally &amp; anatomically proven frugivores. humans are by CHOICE omnivores which is unnatural and terrible for our health. our bodies are not designed to eat meat and it has a huge affect on our energy and overall health and well being. 

I’m 22, had a baby girl about 9 months ago. found out late, had her super early &amp; everything was all such a shock, my boyfriend and I had to find an adoptive family in no time. when you choose an agency, you can’t back out so we had ~10 options to choose from based on our preferences of holistic, health conscious, nature lovers, etc. there were two families that somewhat met that criteria: one had a huge garden, the other loved hiking. we were torn &amp; decided to meet with both over the phone to talk about diet &amp; such. I was prepared to simply see if either would be willing to raise our girl plant-based, but I wimped out because I didn’t know how to approach the situation. I didn’t want to be pushy &amp; start a bad relation with the family. anyways we decided on the hiking fam. we LOVE them. they’re in a neighboring state but we met with them a few times while our girl was still in the hospital &amp; visited &amp; stayed w them for my bday. they treat us so well, we are so happy with our decision. 

the mom’s mom is vegetarian &amp; years ago inspired them to go vegetarian for a bit, but with their busy lifestyles, they fell off&amp; haven’t mentioned a want to go back. they know we are vegan but I haven’t been comfortable asking them to raise our girl plant-based yet. they are in their 40’s and not very health conscious. after staying with them for a few days, here’s a jist of their diet: they eat some home cooked meals with non-organic UNWASHED fruits&amp;veggies, but also fast food, eggos, doritos, etc. it kills me knowing they are feeding her a highly highly processed brand of formula &amp; now dairy, meat, and processed foods. it makes me cry and nearly regret giving her up. I want my baby girl to grow up healthy and strong and make her own decisions on her diet when she’s old enough, but for now we must make the best choices for them. I don’t have any other kids, but I believe as a parent we should do whats best for them NOT what we know best. that means getting educated on all the things, so honestly I’m just upset they are not and upset with myself for not having the balls to speak up. 

we are half their age, could be their children.. so I know it’s easy for them to shrug off anything we say to them regarding diet &amp; health.. knowledge with age mentality, you know? ultimately, it is their girl now so I’m worried they won’t take what we say into consideration. we’re having a really hard time figuring out how to approach this and would greatly appreciate any advice. thank you so much in advance ❤️",1643270800
PlantBasedDiet,Healthiest 2500kcal plant-based diet with less than 35g fiber daily?,"I've had IBS-D since I was born in the 1980s. I stopped eating meat regularly in 2005, gave up dairy in 2010, and went vegan in 2019. Since 2019, I've been trying to stick as closely to WFPB as possible, but am struggling with frequent, urgent bowel movements.

I've found that restricting fiber intake to no more than 35g daily helps a lot, as it gets me down to only 3 or 4 bowel movements a day, and they're much more solid than if I eat more fiber. However, this low fiber intake doesn't appear to be possible while eating WFPB.

I eat a lot of white rice, homemade white bread, and also include some olive oil - although never more than 1 teaspoon per meal as eating a lot of fat in one sitting can also cause me to run to the toilet. My approach is to save my fiber allowance for vegetables, of which I eat a few different types every day. The store I shop at doesn't sell tofu, but occasionally I make a special trip to buy some, and they do sell some fake meat products that work for me. I drink a lot of soy milk.

I've tested negative for celiac and have been through FODMAP elimination and reintroduction without identifying any particular triggers.

I absolutely love eating full WFPB (and it is so much cheaper!) but was nearly housebound for the 6+ months I stuck to it strictly due to going 8+ times a day. Is what I'm doing a good compromise? Is there another way to process the fiber out of food myself or an enzyme or something I can take to break it down? I already peel potatoes, cook everything very thoroughly, etc.",1643268678

Today's breakfast (lunch, actually): salad with chickpeas, red potatoes, vegan queso (homemade, with cashews, sweet potato, nooch, red pepper, and cauliflower), peppers, cucumber.

Afternoon snack: starving right around 3:30PM, so I made oats with berries, mango, flax seeds, chia seeds, and a tablespoon of nuts.

Dinner: broccoli, leftover cheesy chickpeas, rice, cauliflower rice, kale, a few slices of potato, and a very small bit of ham.

Today went a lot better than the other day, but I'm still concerned with my overall caloric intake.

Which recipes are rich in protein and calories (over 1,200 would be nice) but can be made in 30 minutes or less and fit into a 1.5 L box?

So due to many factors both in and out of my control, I am really anxious and it's causing me to have constant stomach aches, as well as food just tasting really bland. Like bananas that I love taste like paste.

In the past, I would eat chocolate and other junk food. I really don't want to do that, but I'm having a hard time eating enough or even getting myself to cook.

What do you guys do during times like this? For me, all of the sources of my anxiety ahouls be gone by 6 weeks, but until then... I just need advice. 

For now, I've only been eating oatmeal and pasta for like 2 weeks and I'm tired of it.

PlantBasedDiet,Struggling with hunger/satiety.,"I have no idea wtf I'm doing with this diet, but it's my second day of giving it an honest go. I've always struggled with my weight (I'm at the high end of healthy BMI) and after seeing the number of people who have lost weight and kept it off effortlessly, I've decided to give the WFPB lifestyle a shot.

Yesterday's first meal: spinach and sweet potato (sprinkled with cinnamon). Probably needs more to it than this, but I had one precooked and it needed eating.

Second meal: 1 cup refried beans (low fat) in a salad with carrots, cucumber, and tomato. This wasn't my first choice, but I started feeling nauseous and dizzy, so I needed something ASAP.

Dinner: Potato soup with mushrooms, kale, onions, red pepper, cauliflower, beans. Still hungry after dinner so had another sweet potato.


Midnight snack: Woke up starving. Had some soup and broccoli.

I know I need to plan my meals a little better so they have more protein/fat, but it's a starting point. I could use a few pointers on how to proceed. Today, I'm making cheesy chickpeas (Rip's recipe) with rice and Brussels sprouts...I added a touch of blended cashews for a bit of extra fat... anything else?",1642877254

I met with a dietitian who basically guided me to go wfpb. And then I found this sub and now my lipid profile is totally normal.

My CBC too was totally out of whack and everything is fine.

Next target is that the couple of markers in lft and kft which are still off should also go down. And most importantly my hypertension that I'm on meds for should start reversing.

The best part is I wasn't 100% plant based. I have white meat twice a week and milk twice a day. But I have made a conscious effort of eating more plant based, more vegetables, more lentils and beans and it's showing.

I wasn't eating unhealthy before either, cooking entire days meals with maybe 2 tbsp oil, eating lean meats and eggs etc. But even then the changes are staggering. I say this so the people who are worried about not being able to follow it 100% would know that starting and doing at least as much as possible is also going to bring big rewards.

I am new to the sub, and excited to be here and learn from all of you. 

I have been doing lazy keto and IF and now want to switch to plant based diet. 

I have a ton of question and most of them I am sure will be stupid. 

Can oils be used for cooking? Like olive oil/butter/ghee? Complete no or a little bit in cooking is acceptable?

Can I have yogurt? in limited quantity?

Keto is heavy on getting macros right, is there such a thing for plant based and tracking? Perhaps only track calories?

Can I eat pasta, or is that processed wheat? Any alternative?

Can I have beyond meat type things, this is only when I am busy, and don’t have time to prep and cook or too stressed or any other life situation where a quick meal is required without too much thought. 

Can I have oats? 

Any rice alternatives?

Occasionally Sugar free drinks, are they ok?

Greens that I eat now - broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussel sprouts, green peppers, carrots, cucumbers, asparagus. 


I am sure I will have more questions.",1642603258

PlantBasedDiet,"Vitamin E, how much do you really need?","If you've tracked your food on cronometer, you've probably found you are vitamin e deficient.  But how much vitamin e do you really need on a wfpb diet?

[Dr. Jeff Novick explains](https://www.drmcdougallforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=6732#p46828):
&gt;Vitamin E recommended levels are based on the intact of poly-unsaturated fats (PUFAs) in the ""average"" diets, which in the USA, is fairly high. The reason is, one of the main functions of Vit E in the body is to prevent oxidation and PUFA's oxidize easily. So, if you are following the recommendations here and consuming a lower fat diet with no added oils, your requirement for Vit E will be much lower, possible even 1/3 to 1/2 the DRI/RDA.

&gt;Based on the info below, If the total fat in the diet is 10% and you consume 1800 calories, that is 20 grams of fat. IF this was all PUFA, you would need about 8 mgs/day to have a ratio of Vit E/PUFA of 0.4. As only about 1/2 to 1/3 of it is PUFA, your requirement may be as low as 3-5 mgs a day, which is about 30% of the DRI of 15.

&gt;PS Interesting that in general, Vit E is found in foods that are higher in fat (except for a few green leafies). So, in nature, if you ate more fat, you also got along with it, more Vit E as it occurred in higher amounts in the fattier foods. The Vit E was protecting the food in the plant and protecting you once you ate the food. However, in our modern processed refined diets, we eat foods high in fat, that have the Vit E removed in the processing. The irony of all of this, is that if you want to meet the RDA for Vit E, you usually have to eat some higher fat foods (nuts, seeds). But, then your need for Vit E also goes up, but only because you are now eating a higher fat diet. So, when people recommend eating more nuts/seeds to meet Vit E requirements, they are both ""right"" and ""wrong"" at the same time.


TLDR: 0.4mg vitamin e per gram of polyunsaturated fat is optimal. 

 since plants also use vitamin e to protect fatty acids from oxidation, vitamin e is naturally present alongside PUFAs at roughly this 0.4 ratio.",1642382078

I like curries with rice and I use coconut milk, coconut cream or almond milk in them for the sauce. 

I eat a lot of pasta in which I’ll add sauces that are generally rather fattening too. 

I find it hard to cook a decent dinner without olive oil or some of these high-fat ingredients.

I desperately love (vegan) chocolates and ice creams… help meeeee! 

I would love any tips on good, yummy, FILLING recipes that don’t have bizarre ingredients I can’t find at my local grocery store. Maybe there’s a website filled with these sorts of recipes??

There are a few people in my life (like, for example, my Girlfriend) whom I love very much, who love me very much, who can't seem to understand Vegan does not equal healthy. A common refrain would be:

""Oh, and look, it's Vegan!"" when looking at an Amy's Pizza. 

""Hey, you can eat this, it's Vegan!"" on something loaded up with salt or oil.

Weirdly enough, they seem to get it with things like Oreos, because they know those are junk food.

Don't get me wrong, I 100% appreciate that they are thinking of me, and are trying. Please don't read this as me not appreciating that. But it's become an issue as more and more vegan junk food is slipping into my life.

I did a short water fast before transitioning into plant based to help with palette transition. I ended that fast on Sunday. Here is a food log for my past few days

Sunday

* Homemade veggie broth ( yellow onion, Shitake mushrooms, carrots and celery with bay leaves and pepper corns. Very simple. no sodium)
* The broth was used to make a simple soup of Broth, Tofu, Green Onion, shitake mushrooms.
* 2 ears of corn on the cob
* Carrots &amp; red onions in apple cider vinegar

Monday

* Giant salad with the following
   * Romaine lettuce
   * Grape tomatoes
   * Cucumber
   * carrots
   * green pepper
   * celery
   * balsamic vinegar
   * tumeric
   * red onion
* Lettuce wraps filled with a bean mixture
   * Black beans ( cooked with cumin, oregano, chili powder)
   * Oyster Mushrooms, garlic and green bell pepper sauted with the veggie broth)
   * Sliced red onion

Tuesday

Same as monday except I added black beans to my salad and in my wraps I added tomato and swapped my bell pepper for jalapeno. 

I'm not hyper concerned but since it's the second time i've seen this ( last time was about 1 year ago. I was eating more plants at the time but not really full wpb and again it seemed like dropping arugula solved it.",1641967075

PlantBasedDiet,Foods with NATURALLY high sodium/salt?,"I was just discussing this topic with a friend and I noticed something peculiar. When we talk about SOS free foods, we usually refer to foods without _added_ salt, oil, and sugar. However, there are of course foods that are _naturally_ higher in these ingredients. Examples include avocados and nuts (naturally higher oil content), and whole fruits such as pineapple or mango (naturally higher sugar content). The naturally sweet whole foods are especially hard to miss.

But I realized that we don't really have many (or any?) foods that are so naturally high in sodium or salt that we would take a bite and immediately recognize them as being naturally high in sodium or salt. I did some googling and turns out that celery is quite high in sodium, but I don't think anyone has ever bit into a celery stalk and accused it of being ""too salty.""

Can anyone think of foods **naturally** high in sodium or salt?

I know [Dr. Alan Goldhamer discussed why added salt can be just as deleterious as added sugar and oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaWVflQolmM&amp;t=956s), but do any of the revered plant based physicians or authors discuss this interesting discrepancy regarding naturally occurring high salt foods?",1641845021

Took a few months for my sense of smell came back (March 2021), when it did, everything tasted bad. Meat smelled and tasted rancid and nasty, coffee, and nuts taste burnt, onion and garlic smelled like death to me. A year later now and a lot of things still don't taste right. Some meat is OK, but still not great, chicken is kinda bad. Coffee is still not like it should be. Onion and garlic are still vomit inducing. My sensitivity to garlic is off the charts. I can smell it on people who ate the smallest amount of garlic for dinner last night. I think I may be a vampire now. /s 

About the only things I can eat that are 100% enjoyable all seems to be on the plant based category. My daughter, who has the same same issues,  and I made some dishes out of a vegan cookbook she had, carrot and pea rice with aromatic spices, and sweet potato dipping fries with a tomato and red pepper puree dip. It was glorious! I'm looking at plant based recipes and  thinking, yeah, I want that in my belly. I just want good food that I can enjoy! 

I've always been a meat eater, did KETO up until my taste came back all crazy. I'm reading up on this plant based wol, and as strange as it is for me to admit, I can do this, think i'm on-board.

PlantBasedDiet,22 Y.O looking for meal ideas,"Not sure this exactly fits, but I've found lots of great recipes here before and I'm looking for some more targeted to my new situation.

I'm 22 Y.O., a college student, BMI around 27 (middle of the overweight range). I've been overweight as long as I can remember. I've tried losing weight before (tracking calories), but have struggled with consistency (ADHD, I'd just forget) as well as cravings and appitite aside from when I was on a study medication to control them. I'm actually at a lower weight than my heaviest though, by about 30lbs. I've been hovering around my current weight for at least 3 years, with some moderate fluctuations.

Recently, I had blood work for something unrelated, and got some concerning results about some liver functioning, cholesterol, and also very low vitamin D levels (which have always been fine in the past, even when I was strictly vegan). My doctor was tentatively concerned,  and prescribed a high dose Vit D supplement, and follow up blood work in a few months. They said that the liver stuff *could* be from recently having COVID.  But given my low D (even with a diet that should be rich in it, and having been outside more the past 6 months than typical for me), I'm worried it could be the start of something serious like NAFL. 

The main treatments for NAFL seem to be lifestyle things that are a good idea anyway, like better diet and exercise, so I figure that I will focus on those as an outlet for my medical anxiety until my next bloodwork.

I've been vegan, ""mostly plant based"", pescatarian, and vegetarian in the past. I definitely don't want to eat meat at this stage, and ideally would like to be entirely plant based. I don't drive, and most of the grocery shopping is done by a roommate who does. I'd like to find healthy recipes that are simple in terms of components and quick to cook, and lowish in sodium, without added sugars or many simple carbs. Something akin to the Mediterranean diet, without the animal protein. Any suggestions?

Thanks!",1641574990

*Processing img b1x4ggf4r3a81...*

 

Ben pulled up to his friend's house, the music was thumping people were hanging out and chit-chatting. He soon made his way inside to be greeted by the smell of delicious food. Ben was hungry. His head spun around the room to find the table; it was pushed up against the way in the corner with a full spread. Drinks, dip, chips, and lots of grub. He hurriedly gave everyone a shout-out then made a b-line to the table. He piled his plate high and pulled up a chair at the bar. 

 ""This food is banging,"" he mumbled with a mouth full of potato salad. His friend [Soul](https://twitter.com/Soultherapy_09) had pulled up a chair beside him with a plate like his. The two made small talk in between the pleasurable sounds of agreement on how good everything tasted. 

“This is some good Vegan food,” Soul smiled winking at Ben. 

""Vegan Food,"" Ben was so shocked he dropped his fork on the ground.

📷

""Yeh, vegan,"" she repeated.

""Didn't you see the note on the table beside the dishes,"" she shrugged

 ""No, I didn't see any note!"" He barked.

""I was so hungry I had no idea that there was vegan food here.""

Ben looked disgusted as if vegan was an alternative species as if he had accidentally eaten fish food or something. His only reference point for vegans was the annoying people on his timeline, radicals throwing paint on furs, or his one friend that guilts him out of eating chicken wings every time they hang out. The shock and hidden pleasure he felt from that meal haunted him the whole ride home. 

*""I should have known something was up,""* he thought as you gripped the steering wheel. The way his friend kept snickering and asking him how he liked the meal should have told him something was up. 

📷

*I can't shake the feeling, or the taste of the egg-free, butter-free cookies.* *Not to mention the taco dip I scarfed down. I couldn't tell it wasn't ground beef.* *On the low, I feel violated for not being told sooner but at the same time I want more.*

The next few weeks were torture, he wanted to talk to someone but made so many vegan salad eating jokes he didn't know who to trust. Every night he would sneak off to binge-watch YouTube and Tik-Tok cooking videos. He eventually found a Vegan YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vegan%20youtube) and bookmarked about ten recipes that he wanted to try at home.

 Late one night, Ben sat down to check his crypto portfolio; everything was good for the most part so, he pulled up a few vegan documentaries. He watched them all and soon found himself pondering the connection between veganism and the crypto he loved so much. Funny enough it was his annoying vegan friend who introduced him to Bitcoin a few years ago. Crypto changed his life, she tried to change his diet but that's where he drew the line. 

📷

 Recently, he got put on to[ NFT's](https://opensea.io/collection/theyummyburger) they opened a whole new world. The NFT world reminded him of his love for art. and pulled him into social spaces to meet people he may have otherwise never met.  The more he thought, the clearer the picture became. Both veganism and crypto are disrupters, changing the old paradigm and introducing a new way of doing things. Both have pioneered and those who have taken an opposing side fighting to uphold the system as it was. Both get mainstream attention which in turn attracts the authentic and charlatans alike. Both are like the wild-wild west uncharted territory with major prospects of gold-digging. Both have junk clouding the judgment of newcomers who are unsure where to start and how to maintain in this new space. Finally, both have room to grow, education opportunities, and space to integrate the old and the new. Ben started to understand that to value one doesn't mean you have to devalue the other. 

At that moment, he picked up the phone to give that crypto vegan chick a call. She knew he would call and answered on the first ring.

PlantBasedDiet,Estimate your net renal acid load,"You can estimate your net renal acid load based on dietary factors using this equation

    NRAL = 0.91P - 0.57K + 21 
where P is grams of protein and K is milligrams of potassium divided by 39.1 (potassium in millimoles)



For example: according to cronometer, one day I ate 97.6g of protein and at least 10860.5mg of potassium (84.6% confidence rating).  

NRAL = 0.91\*97.6 - 0.57*(10860.5/39.1) + 21 = -48.5

If you adjust the potassium level upwards by a factor of (100/84.6), NRAL drops to -77.3

NRAL is dimensionless with higher values indicating more acid load.  The values observed in the paper were between 12 and 136.  My values are much lower than the ones cited in the paper, but I also consumed way more potassium than any of the subjects.

PlantBasedDiet,Vent: “It has bacon but it’s plant based!”,"My family is filled with narcissists. When I made the transition when I was like, 15 , everyone legitimately lost their  minds save my father. Even though I told everyone it reduced my pain and made me feel better.

Even after the 3 months every Sunday where everyone was passive aggressive because I ate pasta they all were eating, except I didn’t reach for meat balls. Because that’s horribly rude!!!

But I thought it would end. I never brought it up. But it never did. After my father passed away still wanted to keep fighting and battling because she believed it would “cure” my condition.

And the god dam excuses she kept using was outrageous.

Huge slab of fish out in my food when no one else had it: “fish isn’t meat”

Family brings over tray of all meat for my dads funeral and I ate literally nothing: you’ll eat this right ? It was given to us free!

My grandmother wanted complete control. So she would nonstop begin sobbing if she realized I ate someone else’s food when I stayed over post death. She fell on her knees over a can of soul for gods sake.

But i draw the line here: she kept making me “plant based” soups. I couldn’t figure out why on earth she kept asking how I felt.

I kept vomiting which was weird. She kept yelling at me over it sobbing. Guess I’m suppose to ignore the pain ?

And then after the 5th time I demanded to know what it has

“No no it’s nothing! All plants ! It has bacon for flavoring but it’s not in the food, it’s flavoring it!”

This is why I throw out all your food .


You become passive aggressive al the time over this. You don’t watch anyone else not eat certain items in the table, just me.

And you began sobbing because I told you I didn’t want any more of her food.

There is always a excuse for you to poison me isn’t there? But it doesn’t matter how many times I vomit! You deep down know why I’m disabled and will spend even more than the 10 years that have passed arguing about this like you are a victim. Crying to other people about how I’m mean and bad.

For gods sake. I was with you last night at another family members house celebrating. And there was multiple types of the same food. And you asked me which one I wanted. I told you the one without meat.

You pretended not to hear me, asked again.

I repeated the one without meat.

“Okay” and she knowingly grabbed the one with meat and ploped it in front of Me.

I’m done with this.

PlantBasedDiet,Food: Healthiness vs calories,"Hi.  
I have an issue I would love to have advice for.  
I find it hard to get in enough calories with the healthy foods that makes my body feel/function the best. This is low fat whole plant based foods like whole grain, legumes, fruit, vegetable, nuts and seeds. I have low appetite and this healthy food is really filling.  
As a result I have added calorie dense, oily, salty and sugary foods/drinks on top of this to get in enough calories. But I fear this is holding my energy levels back in the long run.  


I am having some ideas:  
1. Accept it! Eat healthy and let the weight reduce until it stablizes? Maybe it will around 72 kg (past experience). Currently happy with a more ""muscular"" 88kg, 185cm 29y male.  
2. Replace carbohydrate sources with refined variants to lower fiber content.  
3. Cut back fruit and vegetables servings from 4-8 down to 2-4, making room for more calorie dense whole grains/legumes.  
4. Stuff myself beyond appetite and hope body adapts over time to increased food volume/intake.

1. Admits humans are omnivorous.

2. States that a raw diet is inadvisable.

3. Believes that the research isn't entirely settled in regards to the consumption of animal products in the typical diet. (He has stated that high consumption of animal products is harmful but the research doesn't account for the separation of minimally-processed animal products and highly-processed junk food.)

When one forgoes eating animal products they usually aren't consuming saturated/trans fat and dietary cholesterol which we know causes plaque build up in the arteries. I can see how eating plant based diet prevents more build up from occuring but I don't know how it removes plaque that is already there. Are the plant based meals themselves the cause of the removal or is the lack of consuming saturated fats causing this removal.

PlantBasedDiet,Need Ideas For My Husband’s Midwestern (Boring) Palate,"I cook for myself, my husband, and our teen daughter. We know that eating plant-based is best, but my husband is a bit of a grumbler. The problem is that he is not adventurous in any way, while my daughter and I could live on curries, Japanese or Korean noodle soups, and all foods my husband considers unpleasant. His mother was a farm girl from Texas long long ago, and he loves all things “meat and potatoes”. I’m looking for ideas for easy (low prep) Instant Pot type meals that might appeal to a dull Midwestern palate. 

He does love Mexican food, so we have beans, rice, salsa all dialed in. We also have vegan lentil chili on the menu as well as a sundried tomato pasta dish. 

I’m looking for more ideas. Is it crazy to add that he won’t eat Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, mushrooms, or tofu? There might be some things I missed. Sigh. I feel such a burden cooking for this grumbly man, but expecting him to cook for himself isn’t an option (already tried that). If I want to be healthy myself, I need to get animal products OUT of my house, so that means I want to try cooking more meals for Grumbly Man.

I eat mostly plant based, vegetarian but with so many new plant based and vegan options I’ve been eating more processed food than I have ever done in my life.

Eight years ago these vegan frozen and fast food options didn’t exist and I admit that I’ve gone off the deep end indulging. It just so exciting to have convenience and so many options now.

I want to buckle down but there seems to be so many wfpb staples I don’t like:

-lentils and legumes  

-barley

-squash and zucchini 

- tempeh 

-sweet potato

- tofu (texture issue can’t get past the texture at all. Not firm, not grilled, fried, I just can’t)

-avocado (texture issue)

As you can imagine, it's greatly impacted what I can eat in the plant-based world. So many of the prepared food options use yeast extract as a flavoring (like most of the broth in my local stores), pretty much making it so I have to prep everything. It's exhausting. On top of that, I don't tolerate a lot of grains really well now either (buh bye farro).

PlantBasedDiet,A Balanced Diet And Me,"Hello! Excited to be here!

I have been vegetarian for 14 years and completely animal product free for 1 year and some change. 

I have been experiencing some extreme fatigue recently and my partner is worried about me. He is concerned that I am not getting the nutrients I need in my diet because, I'm going to be honest with you, I am definitely a junk food person. 

I have been working very hard in healthcare during a pandemic, dealing with some unrelated health issues, and extreme financial stress lol I also have BED. So... Food became an unhealthy coping mechanism for me and now, here I am. 

I want to change my diet up for the better and make sure I am getting the things my body needs weekly. I know trying to eat perfectly balanced every day isn't possible, but I figured I could maybe look at it from a week long period. 

My biggest concerns are B12, iron, calcium, vitamin D3, and omega 3 fatty acids. 

Figuring out what foods and how much to eat of what foods to give myself the nutrients I need has been pretty overwhelming for me!!! I downloaded an app that analyzes the contents of the foods I eat, and that has helped some, but I feel like I could use more personal advice.

I am open to any suggestions, advice, and tips you have for keeping my body healthy and happy. How have you gone about it? How do you meal plan? How do you break down what you need?",1638982140

I'm ftm transgender and am on hormone replacement therapy, and my current goal is to lose the love handles/feminine thighs/feminine butt that female puberty left me with. I have suffered from very bad eating disorders in the past, so I do not want to use fasting or restricting calories to aid with this, rather just having an clean diet with plenty of excercise. I did a good amount of research at the beginning of this week and went to the grocery store to pick up a bunch of food, and I've been doing good so far! I picked up red kidney and black beans, lentils, brown rice, tofu, broccoli, peas, Dave's powerseed bread, corn, oatmeal, olives, chickpeas, hummus, and lemon juice(to flavor the brown rice), strawberries, and blueberries. This week I've been eating a bit of each of these each day, sort of mix and matching them into either a rice and veggie bowl or a veggie sandwich with hummus.

PlantBasedDiet,Ideas while living with FIL who has a tiny fridge.,"We bought a new house. Whoo. It’s being renovated and won’t be finished until end of January. 

Until then we’re staying with my father in law because we had to paint our rental before handing it over and give them time to find new tenants: 

We had a double fridge which was easy to stock with tasty veggies and fruit and batched meals but my FIL has a tiny fridge. 

I made a small pantry in our bedroom while we’re here with all the staples. 

He’s a meat eater to the core. Meat and either rice or potatoes every night for dinner. 

I don’t have a ton of space in the fridge because 90% of it is meat, cold cuts, cheese and eggs.

I absolutely do not want to disrupt his routine so I’m unable to batch cook. 

I have spoken to hubby and I’ll take over the two veggie baskets .

I’m looking for ideas for sauces I can make to “finish” my dinners. 

I can steam / cook veggies every night. I can also take a serving of potatoes or rice - depending on what he cooks. 

Can open a can of beans or bake tofu. But I’m really struggling on how to make these meals more “fulfilling”. 

I’m used to really delicious wfpb food (am a subscriber of CFDG) and love having sauce to accompany my bowls. 

Am thinking if I use 1.5 of the baskets with veggies, I can make a few jars of sauce I can just add to my bowls every night. 

Any ideas?

When I try to eat plant based I end up not eating enough and getting so hungry that I relapse into my bullshit diet of fast food and take out. I need to last a few weeks to get into a good routine but I need to find things that keep me full.

A lot of people in this forum suggest nuts, but I'm allergic to peanuts and all tree nuts besides coconut. Also allergic to avocados and bananas.

I work at a restaurant for 40 hours a week and the 8 hour shifts with no break really make it hard to not be a pissed off hungry hippo by the end of the shift.

Should I make protein bars or something? 

I need to lose about 40 pounds and I could really use some tips to finally make this change stick.  I dont want to die young because I couldnt control my habits.",1638337315

PlantBasedDiet,Ex - low carb in need of advice,"  I started a WFPB diet a month ago after I watched a lot of interviews with dr Barnard, dr Klaper, dr McDougall and I believe in their message, it makes a lot of sense. But since being on the low carb/keto bandwagon for a year I sometimes still hear the mantra 'carbs are the devil'. It doesn't help that I feel bloated, but still hungry, constantly thinking of food, I just feel like I am losing control.

Currently I feel like I am gaining weight, my hunger is insane, even though I eat till I feel full mostly vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, with a side of carbs, without nuts, oils, bread, pasta, sugar etc. As fats, I eat a tbsp of chia seeds, flax or pumpkin seeds.

I know it is too soon to expect to see results, it's only been a month, but to be honest I am terrified of gaining back weight. I still have at least 20kg more to lose to be considered  normal weight which is what I want. 

A (lot) of backstory: I have struggled with my weight all my life, I have been yo-yo dieting (from 45kg to my highest 98 kg in early 2020). That's when I started with low carb and intermittent fasting, transitioned to alternate day fasting and a vegetarian diet, still keeping pretty low carb. I lost 20kg in this time, but my weightloss has hit a plateau for almost 5 months and now I am constantly losing and regaining 3-5kg. Started going to a gym, working out for 1.5h to 2h 4-5 times a week. Not much improvement weight wise, or measurements, just an increase in strength. 

I decided to go WFPB which seems like the natural next step. I started this new lifestyle in late october. I also decided to stop alternate day fasting for now because I don't think i can manage to eat so many calories from a WFPB diet with no oil, low in fat. I eat a lot of veggies, mushroom, fruits, but I have a food intolerance which prohibits me to eat cashews, almonds and most tree nuts.

If you have any advice, reassurances, success stories, or not so successful ones, send them my way, they will be appreciated. Thanks for reading my long ass post.",1638231727

My moms three favorite “seasonings” when I was growing up were salt, pepper, and butter lol I’ve tried a few random spice mixes we’ve got in our drawer, as well as just throwing random flavors I like together but it never really seems to taste that great. I don’t know if maybe certain spices need to be cooked differently because when I use things like garlic or onion (the dried stuff in a shaker) the whole meal tastes grainy to me even if I only use a little. 

I guess I’m wondering if there might be some kind of resource online that teaches you how to season veggies.

PlantBasedDiet,Thanksgiving Woes,"Not sure where to post this but I need advice.

My sister and brother-in-law eat a whole food, plant based diet. However, my husband does not. Last year for Thanksgiving we hosted at my house. I had a lot of fun picking out new recipes and preparing a meal. It was 100% plant based. We have a rule at my house between my husband and I, that no matter what the other person cooks, you have to eat it. So if he cooks, I eat it or if I cook, he has to eat it. This made last year’s Thanksgiving enjoyable to me (maybe not so much to my husband) because I did all the cooking. I would say that we had a lovely dinner.

Also I need to note is that my husband is on the thin side. He has struggled for a long time to gain weight. He typically eats sweet potatoes and whole milk to try to bulk up (in opposition to eating junk food). He also weight lifts. Still he struggles to bulk up. He wants to consume animal protein to help with his weight gain. He is also from a culture where many traditional dishes are made with meat so it is also his comfort food. 

Fast forward to today and my sister is hosting this year. In the past, when we have visited my sister, it has been all plant based. This bothers my husband because he feels that when they visit us, we take a lot of time and consideration into making a meal they would like and he doesn’t feel that that is being reciprocated. If he brings his own meat dish, my sister won’t let him use any of her plates or silverware because the meat will “contaminate” them. This makes my husband feel disrespected, like he’s being treated like “germs”. 

My husband has already expressed to me his disdain for going to my sister’s house. Is there anything I could say to tactfully maneuver between my sister and husband? Or any strategy I can employ to smooth things over?",1637694991

I haven't really enjoyed flax as an addition to most foods.

A flax oil supplement includes the oil from about 1T of flax seed. It is missing the bit of fiber and other nutrients that would have come with the flax itself.

My thought is that it's better to get Omega 3 every day, sometimes from a supplement, rather than try to cram flax into foods I don't like it in.

PlantBasedDiet,How do I get more calories,"So I've been eating semi plant-based for a while now, but more recently I've been going all in, and eat around 90-100% plant-based. The problem is, though I feel completely full, I know I'm not getting enough calories because I've been super bloated (I know it's not from an increase in fiber because I've had that issue and this isn't it) and I've been binging unhealthy foods more, even though I honestly don't crave junk food. The thing is I notice that after a binge I don't feel stuffed like I did when I was overweight. I'd feel full, but completely content with my hunger. For example, I decided to treat myself and eat pizza, it was thin-crust and relatively low in calories in moderation, and I would pair it would fruit and veg. I ended up eating the enitre pizza and a little more, around 1200 calories, which I thought would make me sick, but it didn't. I wasn't bloated, and I feel a normal amount of fullness.

So this leads to the question: how do I get more calories on a wfpb diet so that I don't keep binging? I want to take care of my health, which is why I try to eat as many plants as possible, but it seems like I can't keep up, even if I add in healthy fats.

Literally every recipe I can find calls for oil. I guess that makes sense since it's a ""fryer"" so maybe this isn't good for an oil-free diet. 

I had layered veggies on the trays, but I might try another batch today in a baking dish where I can add a little water and a lid so there is some moisture. Get stuff cooked through, then take the lid off for the final roasting/browning part.

PlantBasedDiet,WFPB experience and questions.,"10 years ago, at my fitness peak, I went from a Mediterranean style diet to a WFPB diet. Didn't ease into it, just went for it. The 8 months I was on WFPB were the best I ever felt, the most energy I ever had. Sadly, my situation at the time made a Mediterranean diet much easier to manage and went back to it. 

Fast forward to 2020, I have been plagued with depression, IBS, Iatal Hernia, oesophagus ulcers from chronic reflux, and a few month ago, I landed in the hospital with acute pancreatitis. After reading on how to heal my pancreas, turns out meat fats are my enemy. So, 3 weeks ago, I went back to WFPB.

On the 3rd day, I was energetic the fog in my head was gone, I was physically able to sustain physical activity again. 3 weeks later, I have been working out 5 days a week, I am able to take on projects, I am upbeat. But through the whole diet change process, which I didn't ease into, I never once felt abdominal discomfort, lack of energy or any of the bad effects I should be feeling according to academic reviews.

I still have 2 vices; I drink 1-2 cappuccino daily and I smoke 1 cigarette daily. The latter which I entend to cut completely in the next few weeks. The former much harder since I love the taste of coffee so much.

So I would like to ask others who are on WFPB:

- Is this type of diet sustainable in long term? Specifically I am using Thrive as a guide, are there other good (or better) sources out there?  

- Do I have to forego coffee completely on this type of diet?

- Do I need to supplement? Is there specific supplements to provide what this type of diet might be lower in?

- What is the catch? Why do I feel so good from literally just changing overnight and don't have any negative effects, is this gonna last or is the bad going to catch up to me eventually?",1636899115

PlantBasedDiet,Finally cooked absolutely non-gassing beans !!!,"Beans can produce quite a bit of **flatulence**. We all know that. I assume most people here know that beans contain non-dietary or non-digestible complex sugars called **oligosaccharides**. When these sugars are ingested they don't get digested and absorbed in our small intestines like the simple dietary sugars do. 


They end up in our large intestine where **anaerobic bacteria** starts to break them down to simple sugar components which begin to ferment and create several gasses in the process. Most notably methane, Co2 and So2. 




An enzyme called **Alpha-galactosidase or α-GAL**, normally contained in beans along with the oligosaccharides, is needed to break them down into simple constituents. α-GAL enzyme is component of Beano, that some people take before meal. We don't produce α-GAL but some gets absorbed from our GI tract and is found in saliva. Eating beans very slow helps with the breakdown of oligosaccharides so less of it ends up undigested feeding anaerobic bacteria. This is certainly not enough and most people don's have significant concentration of α-GAL in their saliva. 



Because oligosaccharides are water soluble a common method of removing them is soaking in a large amount of water, sometimes twice in an attempt to dilute these sugars. Alkaline solution helps speed up the process but this method doesn't work well on Soybeans and almost not at all with white navy beans. The best effect has been found to be on black beans where about 75% of these sugars were removed, and only about 5% in white beans under same conditions. 



I think that wasn't fair for the white beans, hence I researched further to see what can be done. 




Now a little bit about oligosaccharides.



Beans and in my case Soybeans have two main oligosaccharides: 
**Stachyose** and **Raffinose**. 



On average Soybeans contain around 7.5% of dry weight total sugars. From those total sugars 2% are monosaccharides which are galactose, glucose and fructose, and 5.5% polysaccharides most notably oligosaccharides, the Stachyose and Raffinose.



There is on average 4.5% Stachyose and 1% Raffinose in soy beans. 



Mungbeans have about 50% less sugar than Soybeans in the similar proportions.



Now some notes about Raffinose and Stachyose:



**Raffinose** is a **trisaccharide** composed of one galactose unit, one glucose unit, and one fructose unit. 



**Stachyose** is a **tetrasaccharide** consisting of two galactose units, one glucose unit, and fructose. 



**α-GAL** is enzyme that hydrolyses Raffinose and Stachyose breaking them down into simple monosaccharide components that are now available for absorption without going further down our GI tract causing flatulence. 



Luckily beans already contain this enzyme, which is activated during germination. When seed absorbs 50% of the dry volume water the germination is initiated α-GAL is activated. Breakdown of Stachyose and Raffinose starts and after 4 days of germination the sugars are completely converted to monosaccharides. 



At the bottom of this post is link to an article in which near the end of the page 2 (442 of the journal) you can find a table with measurements of the content of Stachyose and Raffinose sugars after 0,1,2,3,4 days of germination. 





So I did a 3 day germination in dark until sprouts were about 2 lengths of the bean. About 1/2"" to 3/4"" long. 



I cook them as usual in an Instant Pot (pressure cooker) for 30 minutes. 



I tasted the beans and new that I won the war against oligosaccharides right there. 



How I new it? There were so sweet it's just like if I added sugar in the pot.  


Oligosaccharides don't taste sweet at all but after breaking them down we can taste the simple sugars. They are not used up by the new sprouts (yet) only released. 



So far I germinated Soybeans and White navy beans and the effect is same. Absolutely no flatulence at all. 



I made bean stew so now I just have to adjust spices to compensate for the new sweetness, which I don't mind. 



Sorry for the long post.

PlantBasedDiet,Is 17g ALA too much?,"I eat ungodly amounts of flax because it makes for cheap calories and it's a cool flex when other healthy minded people ask about what I do for Omega 3 if I don't eat fish. It's getting mildly ridiculous how much I can hide in smoothies so I want to check that this isn't bad for me. I eat about 7 grams of ALA in two smoothies (33g of flax each time) and the rest of the ALA comes from kale and other foods. 

I'm not concerned with the cyanide [influence from that much flax](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00204-015-1479-8/MediaObjects/204_2015_1479_Fig3_HTML.gif) (33g at a time. I am assuming it will act about like the 30.9g from that chart). I don't know how almond fares alone, but [this chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00204-015-1479-8/MediaObjects/204_2015_1479_Fig3_HTML.gif) shows that almonds paired with other cyanide raising foods does impact cyanide levels pretty well too, with only 10g of almonds - about a rounded tablespoon). 

Seeing as how people commonly consume more than 10g of almonds at a time in snacks, almond butter, or as almond flour; I'd bet &gt;10g (say like eating 1/4 a cup or 1/2 cup) of almonds would probably par right up with 30.9g of flax (or surpass it) in terms of cyanide influence. I haven't heard of there being a cap on almonds due to health concerns about cyanide but perhaps I""m wrong

I have been somewhat vegan for 4 years, but always had the occasional slip ups at parties, holidays, special events…etc. I would even slip up every weekend because hey I wanted to live life, now I know this may have been my downfall? Because of recent health issues I have been strictly vegan for past 3 months. I have been doing SO much research on a healthy diet for pcos and diabetes because the major contributor of hormone imbalances is related to insulin resistance. What I have found is that the evidence suggests so many different things! Some say low fat high carb diet is good, some say limited carb high protein and moderate fat, and you all know the other- high fat, high protein, very low carb (looking at you keto). All have different takes and I have to say that low carb does seem to make sense because of the insulin spikes…idk what to do or what to follow 

I seem to do best with the high carb vegan diet in weight loss and feeling good about myself, but with recent health issues it’s hard to know what is helping and what is hurting my body. I would like to find actual research on the subject of carbs and insulin but when I look up plant based reasearch from Gregor, Barnard, or essylston, I seem to find the same studies used over and over again(China study or 7 day Adventist study) I’m beginning to think that the vegan diet, which I love don’t get me wrong, is just another cult like fad.

PlantBasedDiet,This Beans on Toast Thing,"Disclaimer: I'm a born and raised midwestern United States, steak and potato kind of culture millennial. I always thought baked beans were only those super sweet, salty, canned variety that usually had bacon and lard in them and were served with ribs, hot dogs, and hamburgers at BBQs, next to the coleslaw, potato salad, and potato chips.

So, when everyone kept saying 'beans on toast' for breakfast ideas for this non-breakfast eating vegan, I was skeptical. Honestly, I thought it sounded disgusting. But, this morning I threw together some simple beans using a basic recipe I found randomly on the internet, tossed them on top of a bagel (the cat got into my whole grain, home made bread so that's all the bread I have right now), and took a bite. I haven't been this surprised since I tried tofu scramble and discovered how amazing that is (being a scrambled egg hater). 

My question is, does anyone have a hearty, healthy, cheap recipe? The one I used was kind of bland and sweet (called for molasses which is fine, but it literally lacked all other flavor). I like a little spice, a little salt, even a little sweet if its offsetting another flavor (such as sweet and spicy). I want to make up a big batch of beans to freeze so I can always have some on hand for breakfast. Something to alternate with my tofu scrambler and hash browns. I do a lot of smoothies but do not find them filling on their own. 

Or, if not a recipe, what are some good flavors to add to the basic recipe (which is basically tomato paste, molasses, onions, garlic, water, beans) to make it a little more flavorful? Not a huge tomato person, but I don't mind some tomato paste or tomato sauce.",1636228998

At the moment it's only available for the UK during the early stage. If you are interested in taking part, please comment or message me directly. 😊",1636211711

PlantBasedDiet,"Significance of calories, fiber, and micronutrients being structurally intact?","How Not to Die says eating berries can blunt the insulin spike from \[other\] high-glycemic foods (referencing: [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23365108/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23365108/)), hence my question: In order for food to be healthy, must the fiber and micronutrients come structurally intact with the same whole food that offers the calories, or could one get away with mixing them in extracted forms? For example, if you hypothetically extracted the sugar from an apple, would eating both the extracted sugar and the remaining sugar-less apple (simultaneously) be roughly as healthy as eating the structurally intact apple prior to the extraction, or would the latter be significantly healthier because its sugars are structurally bound to the fiber or micronutrients in some significant manner? And if the latter, how exactly does the structural integrity prevent the harmful effects of refined sugars/calories?

The practical implications of this question have to do with the safety of adding refined sugars to very high-fiber foods to increase their palatability. I understand that date sugar is the healthiest sweetener (followed by blackstrap molasses and probably jam), whole food is always better than refined food, it's fine to add a little sweetener if it helps you eat a healthy food you otherwise wouldn't, yada yada. I also realize this question is a very complex way of saying I have a sweet tooth &gt;\_&gt;, but nonetheless I think it's very important even just as an academic question.

I finally went to the dr who prescribed me with a weight loss drug that does seem to be helping me with my food addiction but I think that my insurance, once it renews, will no longer cover it so while I have the benefit of that medicine, I'm looking for new habits to start now and then continue them. 

I've realized that counting calories flares up all my OCD and weirdness and food addiction so I started thinking about what I could eat without having to count calories. 

Whole Foods/ no unprocessed foods just makes so much logical sense. My worry is the reliance on actually assembling food and taking the effort to eat healthy. I know for me, in the past, meal prep was key for those busy afternoons at work where I can't seem to make time for myself. 

I do love fruits and veggies and I love all grains - I just need to get away from over processed breads and embrace oats and barley, etc. 

Anyway, I'm going to read the info you've all already shared in this subreddit and see if it's something I can fit into my lifestyle. It's silly to think - can I take the time to cook for myself and be better. Of course I can! I just need to get into the spirit of my life is for me and not for work! 

So hi :) I'll be trolling here for info.

PlantBasedDiet,My dog has been mostly WFPB for three years now,"I rarely talk about my dog's diet with others because people have even more strong opinions about a PB diet for dogs than they already have for humans but I wonder if you all might be a bit more understanding?

It wasn't my intention at all, it just sort of happened -- my dog suffers from many protein allergies (mostly animal and also wheat, sunflower and yeast) and was prone to nasty skin problems and UTIs. I couldn't find any food that he didn't react to so I started making it for him myself after consulting with a veterinary nutritionist and finding the right recipe/macro ratio/vitamins and supplements -- he ended up doing the best on the PB recipes and now it's been three years!  He is a senior dog now but is in excellent health, no skin issues (unless he eats something off the ground) and kidneys/liver have normal levels which were previously always elevated. 

Dogs have different nutritional requirements than humans and are true omnivores, but it's quite interesting to me how beneficial this diet has been for both of us. Ironically, my dog had been more WFPB than me for longer since I only fairly recently weaned off the SOS and vegan processed food.",1636002634

I have two questions:
1) I've been a very healthy weight all my life and exercise regularly including things like p90x regularly and have decent muscle mass. I don't weigh my food or really want to keep track of my protein intake exactly however, I would like to make sure that I don't lose muscle mass and having given up animal proteins I want to make sure I'm eating enough plant based protein. What is a reasonable example of 3 or so meals that would include enough protein for me (I guess something like 150 grams of protein a day given the 1 gram of protein per pound - I'm 160 pounds)?  Currently I eat steel oats with fruit every morning. I tend to eat something like kale with beans and quinoa for lunch and then either tofu or bean pasta for dinner. I know it matters the exact portions, but I'm curious what others do who care about muscle mass.

2) I'm having trouble with avoiding olive oil. It seems to be in everything when you eat out / order in and even though they say ""vegan"" you never know if olive oil (or similar/worse) is part of the food. How do people deal with this constant issue?",1635979181

PlantBasedDiet,Recommendations for sauce rcwioes,"I haven’t been able to find too many sauce recipes with all my restrictions:

-low fat

-no heat/spice 

-no mustard 

-no canned tomato products 

-no coconut 


I cannot handle any spice at all—too much pepper can be too spicy.

A lot of WFPB recipes say the spice is optional but it ends up really bland; I don’t think the recipe makers ever eat their recipes without it and don’t realize how much flavor it lends to the dish.

I am looking for something mostly for a side of steamed veggies (trying to eat more).

I can add spices for flavor and things like garlic, minced onion and such. But I’m out of ideas for a liquid carrier.

I do make date paste, low fat hummus, and I am ok with occasional maple syrup when nothing is prepared.

Totally fine with something more processed as a condiment, but need it to be low fat (no tahini, no avocado).

I would sometimes use soy sauce but I’m waiting until I can afford real soy sauce.

There was a recent video by nutrition facts about braggs liquid aminos not being good for you and the same thing is in cheap soy sauce.

PlantBasedDiet,Concerns about the forks over knives meal plans,"Hi, I've recently decided to try some recipes on the forks over knives meal plan app. I think they are really tasty but I have some concerns.

The app advertises itself as low sodium and low fat, yet it suggests a lot of recipes with added salt and a ridiculous amount of sauces and plant-based butters. I ate the peanut noodles today and I am still full from lunch, but I don't feel like that's much healthier than eating any lighter sauce that contains plant-based oils (I am not encouraging using oils, it just feels weird to me that I get to replace oils with even more fats, I am here to learn).

Also the recipes seem very unbalanced, there are a lot of carbs and fats but not a lot of proteins. I also feel like the calorie count is not accurate as I feel like the peanut noodles I tried today had way more fats and calories than what the app is claiming.

I see a practical side of it and no downside if done sensibly.,"I eat and cook only whole plant foods and actually mostly don't even bother cooking recipes,, but simply cut up a bunch of vegetables and fruits and cook them a pot.  Only spoon required to eat. 




But once a week or so I make a been stew that lasts me for a week or more sometimes.



And I use oil to saute some of the ingredients. 


I know it's possible to saute without oil. I do it often. I also know that my wife screams at me when i saute ingredients that go into a pot of beans to make this been stew. I now use her favorite large pan and I didn't use oil in it for some time. 





I see her point, I pretty much destroyed this pan within a couple of months using it maybe 10 times. 




So for practical technological reasons I started using a small amount of oil. 3 table spoons to be exact.  It's this a small amount?  The amount of ingredients that I make for this stew make up about 6 quarts of stew. 



3 table spoons of oil in 6 quarts works out to be 1/8 of the tablespoon per cup or 15 calories of oil per cup.



For health concerns we are talking about less than 2 grams of oil per cup.




Sauteing with 3 tablespoons of oil makes the actual process so much easier and extend the life of the pan seemingly indefinitely, so to speak for practical purposes. It's a pretty high quality and expensive pan that comes with its own wood spoon. 




I am very ok to do it this way and see only positive side with no ill effect.

PlantBasedDiet,Thoughts on 2 years vegan and going strong,"Yesterday was my 2-year anniversary of going cold turkey into a completely plant based lifestyle. It conveniently coincides with my first “annual” physical exam in 2.5 years. I feel fine and always feel good about what I eat. This started with concern about rising LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and that has turned around (20% drop). And there are so many other benefits. Benefits to self and to the planet.

While it is often a challenge to eat out and find vegan options, there always seems to be something that works even if it is just a couple of side orders. I confess to still missing the taste of a few non-vegan foods, mostly cheeses, but the substitutes work out well enough for me. I have lots to learn to be a decent vegan cook but that will come with more practice.

I supplement daily with Omega 3 and a multi-vitamin. The multi has B-12 but my level has dropped and needs to be dealt with. While it seems that my diet does not include enough calcium, blood work says that is ok. Actually all is good except the B-12. The supplement says it has 667% of the RDA for B-12 but, apparently I need more.

I am fortunate that friends and family are very accommodating of my diet choices. Only one of my friends is vegan. With friends and family, we work it out if our time together includes eating. I might  supply food or we check menus before going to a restaurant or the host makes a point of including plant based selections. In all cases, I am blessed to have such good relationships.

 If you have read this far, I hope my experiences add some insight into what this journey can be. I feel good about my choice to be vegan and can see this as a life-long lifestyle.",1635172247

PlantBasedDiet,Question about store bought cashew milk,"Hello all :]

I've been interested in plant based milks for a while and decided to try cashew milk, as I've heard almond milk was pretty watery and I was afraid it would put me off. I bought Silk unsweetened cashew milk, and I was surprised - I love it! Now since it's a whole ass carton of cashew milk and cashews are hella expensive I know that there can't be a heavy ratio of cashews to water and whatever preservatives are added to make it shelf stable for this price. I also noticed it has kind of an aftertaste, though it's not too bad.

I'm wondering if homemade cashew milk also has a problem with an aftertaste at the sacrifice of losing the shelf stability. All the recipes I'm looking up say that it's only good in the fridge for about three days, so I'm wondering if having a higher ratio of cashews to water would fix the aftertaste problem.

PlantBasedDiet,Advice on navigating the switch to a WFPB and gluten-free diet with an omnivore partner?,"For the past month and a half, I've been going through the process of switching to a WFPB diet. My father recently had a scheduled bypass surgery and there's a lot of heart disease in my family, and I want to take control of my health. Also, I've been increasingly uncomfortable about my cognitive dissonance of identifying as an animal lover yet still eating animal products. 

So far, the diet switch has gone quite well. I have much more energy and have experienced a notable lack of anxiety and fearfulness since starting this diet. I have eaten animal products 3-4 times over the past 6 weeks, but when I thought about doing it a few days ago when I was at a restaurant with poor vegan options, I was grossed out by the idea of animal products and chose to eat a weird vegan option instead. Unfortunately, I also suspect I have issues with gluten as well. In the spirit of brevity I won't go too much into it but I think I will need to have a gluten-free diet as well. 

So, onto my issue. Eating out is a big part of my life. My partner and I are fortunate enough to be able to dine out rather frequently. I live in a part of the U.S. where it is extremely easy to find vegan, gluten-free options wherever I go (though I have accepted that I will eat oil when I eat out; this is not a huge deal to me because I don't have any preexisting health conditions as of yet). However, we also travel quite a bit. In the past, we have celebrated big occasions at Michelin star restaurants, and we have traveled internationally fairly extensively. When (if?) the pandemic is finally under control, we will travel again. In the past, we have made food a central part of our trips. We love exploring a culture through its cuisine, and we typically order many different dishes and share everything. I mourn the loss of this social aspect. 

At home, I do the cooking. I have been meal-prepping quantities of chicken to add to his portion of the WFPB gluten-free meals I've made, and he's more than happy with that. He also recently purchased a grill, and he can learn to cook meat for himself to add to the meals I make. As recently as a few days ago, I thought that I would simply make exceptions to my diet when we go to a fancy restaurant that has a prix fixe menu without vegan options, or when we travel and there are no good options. I figured, a gluten-free diet *has* to be strict, because even a little bit can set off a months-long autoimmune response. But I could eat small amounts of animal products a few times a year without too much detriment to my overall health. 

However, the further I've gone down this path, the more I can't escape the fact that it is against my morals to eat animal products. I've done more research into the matter and I can't unknow what I've learned. I am starting to believe veganism is the only acceptable path for me. I think this is genuinely going to be a relationship hurdle for my partner and I when we travel again. He is a bit of a hedonist and just wants to live the ""good"" life and consume whatever he pleases. I'm sure he would feel better on a WFPB diet, but he doesn't suffer the same ill health symptoms I do; he can eat and drink to his heart's content and feel mostly good. 

I am not going to try to convince him to change his eating habits in any way. I believe the best way to lead is by example, so maybe he will alter his habits and ask questions if he sees my (hopeful) success on this way of eating. But if he doesn't, I won't push the point. He is very willful and will most certainly react to any pressure by doubling down on his position. Plus, I just don't feel that anyone else's consumption is my business. 

Is there anyone who has navigated a similar situation or can offer any advice? The main destination in my mind about this issue is Japan. The last time we were there, we ate ramen, sushi, Izakaya fare (lots of meat and dishes containing soy sauce, which unfortunately contains gluten), curries (usually not vegan and probably containing flour), and burgers. It's his favorite place in the world, and one of mine as well, and eating out is going to be a huge hassle for me, and by extension, for him. I wish he were more supportive but I also understand the annoyance that comes with having to alter a peak experience for yourself because of someone else's choices. I'm thinking this may, in some circumstances, come down to a choice between eating gluten (bad for my health) or animals (against my morals). I am asking for advice and insight here instead of r/vegan because I don't believe I would get any nuanced or empathetic responses over there.",1634966212

PlantBasedDiet,Food Balance,"I'm very new at WFPB, as in I did good for most of one week and fell off the wagon. I still looked up a lot of recipes and ideas so this weekend I plan on meal prepping and really trying to get serious about it. I recently learned my cholesterol is high, I have an elevated liver enzyme, I was put on blood pressure meds - not to mention the 70 pounds I have to lose. I really thought all of this would be enough to motivate me, and it did for awhile, but not enough. I have tried changing the way I eat on and off for years so I have become very, veeerry well-acquainted with my weak areas and downfalls. One of them is striving for perfection or nothing at all. So I've caught myself overthinking again.  

I am not a veggie person. Everyone's food pictures of fresh veggies and salads look so good and I want to like it too, but I just can't. I will eat green beans. I have no problem cramming a few cups of greens into a smoothie, so I've got that going for me. I can tolerate quite a few veggies if they're super soft in a stew or soup form. And of course, the starchier the veggie, the more I'm ok with it. 

I'm drawn to a lot of the black bean/sweet potato dishes, pastas with hidden veggie sauces, other whole grain meals. I do continue to try vegetables cooked in several ways but I will start gagging after a few bites. I will add onions, sweet peppers, etc. to things and I think I'm in the mindset of those not really counting as anything. Only the good green stuff matters. This all becomes very discouraging as I feel like my diet shouldn't consist of mostly grains, starches and legumes. However, again, I know I will fail if I don't like the food I'm eating. I also know that even if I start out with the meals I've listed it's still better than the alternatives I would be turning to. 

Am I wrong in some of my opinions? I'm still researching the ""rules"" of this way of eating. Should I not be worrying about this as much as I am? Will I be just fine with fruits, pastas, and massive green smoothies and vegetable stews? I of course will keep trying with the fresh veggies and hopefully my taste buds will adjust.",1634937634

I've always been a bit of a cookie monster. One fav is gingerbread cookies.  


My thought is I should be able to get a good gingerbread flavour in my oatmeal using the right seasoning, but I've never gotten it right.

I’ve been vegan for almost 3 years. My personal diet kind of flip flops between being a “junk food vegan” to eating regular vegan to whole foods. I want to eat more WFPB for my overall health and for weight loss. 

However, I’m allergic to tree nuts. I avoid peanuts because I had a cross contamination reaction once. I also have to be careful about some seeds, especially “bulk bin” type seeds since cross contamination is very high (and it’s hard to distinguish a sliver of almond from sunflower seeds when it’s all mixed up). I have anaphylactic type allergies to nuts, carry an Epi-pen, and I simply cannot budge or bend on eating nuts.

Being nut-free and vegan isn’t difficult in my day to day life. But I find *a lot* of WFPB recipes, meal ideas, and diet guides rely on nuts. 

**What are some nutrients that are vital in nuts that I’m missing out on?**

I can eat flax and hemp seeds. I don’t like the taste but I can learn to like them. I love sesame seeds and eat a lot of tahini. I haven’t tried chia seeds and sometimes new foods worry me because of my allergies. 

I cannot afford to talk to a dietician or holistic nutritionist.",1634639521

The title says it all basically. At the end of december Im going to a work trip for 6 days. How can I make sure that I have WFPB meals during those 6 days?
I went before on work trips but it was always just 1 to 2 days, during which I just brought 2-3 boxes.
One with just oats, nuts, dried fruits and cinnamon, so I only needed to add tap water to have a decent breakfast. And another with legumes, veggies and some complex carbs, which I could keep in my backpack without a problem since the trip went only 1-2 days.
But how do I do that for 6 days?
I could do the breakfast for 6 days by making oats with nuts/seeds and dried fruit again. Since I can keep it dry, 6 days should no problem. 
But I need at least one decent (enough calories &amp; nutrition from legumes, whole grains &amp; veggies) meal everyday for lunch/dinner, that I can keep for 6 days without it going bad.",1633929719

PlantBasedDiet,Why does my wheatgrass and sprouts always mold?,"Iv been trying to move towards a healthier plant based life style for some time. Having wheat grass in the house really helps me a lot. But I rarely have access to it because 90% of what I grow gets a fine white and black stringy (like a spiders web) Mold growing all along the roots leading towards the green/grass part of the plant itself.  Iv tried growing on plates, in a planter, in a sprouter with holes in the bottom and many other ways. Iv tried changing heat ranges (I tend to keep my house cold) and iv tried changing how thick I layer the wheat grass berries. Iv tried so so many solutions yet 90% of every wheat grass I start ends up with that nasty white and black mold growing on it and I toss it out. My sprouts outside Alfalfa end up the same the majority of the time. For some reason Aflafa is the only sprout I can grow for more than 2-3 days without mold.

Does anyone have tips for what I may be doing wrong or general tips for growing wheat grass in a cold environment? Im happy to buy a sprouter or dedicate a room to help my wheat grass and sprouts finally start turning out. I really just cant seem to freaking figure out why my sprouts and wheat grass molds so fast and reliably!",1633890423

PlantBasedDiet,"I love this diet so much. I had a new realization today about how bad shape I was in previously with previous ""normal"" diet.","So I was at the gym today doing both cardio and strength as usual. I did an hour of cardio at roughly 150bpm breaking a good sweat, divided to two 30min segments on different machines, with strength training in-between. I had this one song playing in my head all the time, so after I was done on my 2 hour routine, I cycled back home, popped open a beer, put that song playing and started dancing while making post-workout grub.

And the thing about dancing that I realized is, after 2 hours of sweaty nearly full-body exercise, cycling to gym and back, I was in no way exhausted. This is absolutely phenomenal. It's as if some sort of base level of tiredness is gone. I've been going to gym a long time and it used to be I came home and crashed on sofa and at most watched telly in drowsy state. I simply am not exhausted the way I used to be.

Currently trying out switching to plant based with IF (yep, saw the Netflix show and jumping on the bandwagon, but I'm a firm believer in there is no one best way to do things and do what works best for you, so I'm going to try it out).
I don't think of myself as a gotta have meat with every meal person, but I see lots of YouTubers who do vegan videos and they really seem to like using plant based meat substitutes. I look at the ingredients and based on staying away from processed food in the past it makes me pause before I can pull the trigger and buy any. 
Is staying away from processed foods as big of a deal on plant based diet?  Are meat substitutes worth it (i.e. if they're bad for you, are they just too good to not use?). I'm trying to form my habits now and want to make sure I set good ones (I tend to cook/eat the same stuff over and over).

PlantBasedDiet,"Has anyone managed to get down to 1-2 non-urgent bowel movements daily on this diet, and if so, how?","tl;dr Multiple urgent bowel movements every day make it difficult for me to live a normal life.

I've seen doctors (9 of them). They've confirmed I don't have celiac or any inflammatory condition. They suggest less fiber, but I don't understand how that's possible without eating dead animals, boosting calorie density with sugar and oil, or eating at an calorie deficit which isn't sustainable as I don't have weight to lose. They also suggest loperamide, which works, but seems to get less effective over time if I take it every day so I'm trying to stay off it for now.

I've recently been through the FODMAP elimination and reintroduction phase. I had liquid diarrhea in reaction to mannitol and fructose so cut them out, but even when eating completely low-FODMAP I'm still going 3-4 times daily and can't confidently go anywhere that doesn't have a bathroom. Leafy greens (which are supposedly zero FODMAP) seem to be particularly bad for creating urgency.

The closest I've gotten to normal is eating only refined wheat and nothing else (2-3 bowel movements a day, less urgent) but that isn't nutritionally adequate.

PlantBasedDiet,Constructive feedback for a vegan restaurant on how to be more WFPB?,"Hey

Sorry if thats a stupid question.
A few weeks ago I wrote a feedback comment to a vegan restaurant which makes plantbased handcrafted meals that seem relatively healthy.
I've eaten there a few times and I like their products but at home I only cook WFPB. I basically wrote them that I like their products but that they would be even better if they move more towards a WFPB direction.
They replied to me and basically agreed. They wrote that they ""process pressed oils only very sparingly and use only fresh, unprocessed raw materials.
Deep-frying, for example, is a no-no, but baking eggplant without oil is hardly feasible and leads to unconvincing results.""

And then they asked if I have any feedback for a specific product. 
I was thinking I could suggest that they make their hummus oil-free and, ideally, with not that much tahini so that it is low-fat. If they arent satisfied with how creamy the hummus turns out, they could consider skinning their cooked chickpeas to make the hummus more creamy, although that would require extra time and effort.
They also use a cashew-dressing &amp; a ginger-miso-dressing in some recipes. I could also suggest that, if its not already the case, they make those dressings without oils.

But other than that I cant think of much.
They use a vegan version of nutella, which I kind of dont dare to criticize because I cant suggest a WFPB alternative that seems feasible and affordable for a small company like that.
What do you think? Id love to give them constructive feedback and help them become more WFPB but Im not an expert and dont know how exactly they make their meals, other than the listed ingredients but there they never mention any oils, even though they use oils. Sparringly according to the mail but they still use them.
If its not against any Reddit rules or so and if people here want it, I can say the name of the restaurant, but the ingredients are in german since its in a german-speaking country.",1633567907

I have an active job, and lose serious weight and strength if I don’t consume enough protein, the answer I’m always given is: nuts, beans, legumes. I love beans and lentils, but they don’t love me. In addition to just normal gas, they’ve started aggravating my IBS and decreasing my DAO enzyme due to digestive strain. This has caused me to start having histamine spikes triggering what appear to be allergic reactions, but to anything and everything. A cup of black tea will send me into a coughing and itching fit, then it’s a bowl of broccoli with salt, then it’s some dried fruit. But after a day or two if abstaining from beans, nuts, and legumes, the itching goes away and I feel fine.

Are there any other plant based ways to get protein? That won’t obliterate my digestive tract?

PlantBasedDiet,Oatly and Ripple are not WFPB compliant,"This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I want to make a teaching moment here and take a quick look of their ingredients shows this to be true.

* https://us.oatly.com/products/full-fat-oatmilk-chilled

&gt;Oatmilk (water, oats), low erucic acid rapeseed oil. Contains 2% or less of: dipotassium phosphate, calcium carbonate, tricalcium phosphate, sea salt, dicalcium phosphate, DHA algal oil, sodium ascorbate (antioxidant), tocopherols (antioxidant), riboflavin, vitamin A, vitamin D2, vitamin B12.

The second ingredient ""low reucic acid rapeseed oil"" or in the US often called canola oil, makes a big impact.  Oats are 15% fat by calories food, hence it's milk should be the same.  Yet:

* 1 cup FF Oatly
* Calories - 160
* Fat - 9 g = 81 calories

If the drink were purely oats, one would expect 15% fat from calories, about 24 in this case but here it's 81 from the canola oil, making this a 50.6% fat by calories product.  Since the oat calories only compromise 79 calories, the oat fats tally to 12 calories and 69 will be canola oil, a little more than half a tablespoon in each cup.

In wfpb accepted milks, you will expect to find macros roughly similar to their host food (almonds to almond milk, say) except the subtraction of most fiber.

I tried making ""oat milk"" at home in a power blender, it's a watery concoction.  Probably could be saved with some cashews, almonds, etc.

PlantBasedDiet,How Herbal Products can Improve Gut Health,"The Pharmaceutical drugs of today come with quite a hefty list of side effects which leads us to question whether they are doing more harm than good. In fact, many synthetic drugs have proven to damage the healthy bacteria in our gut. And when we consider that 95% of serotonin (the happy hormone) is produced in the gut, upsetting the gut should be the last thing that we’d want to do. Luckily there’s a viable alternative. Herbs have been celebrated for generations for their unique healing properties and medicinal potential. It gets even better as herbal supplements have minimal to no side effects. Below are some of the best herbal extracts that have been proven to boost gut health.

**Cranberry Extract:** popularly consumed as a juice, this extract contains compounds known as polyphenols. They interact with pathogenic microorganisms like Escherichia coli present in the gut and blocks their activity, which further boosts gut health.

**Aloe Vera Extract:** over 75 active compounds are present in this extract, from magnesium all the way to potassium. This extract has been used to cleanse the body from within by boosting intestinal absorption. Please clink on the link below to find out more about this wonderful extract!

[https://www.thegoodmoodco.com/blogs/journal/aloe-vera-extract-supports-digestive-health](https://www.thegoodmoodco.com/blogs/journal/aloe-vera-extract-supports-digestive-health)

**Fennel Seed Extract:** this extract is packed with antioxidants that fights free radicals and inflammation within the gut.

Hopefully this just goes to show that we no longer need to compromise our gut health whenever we’re feeling a bit stressed or under the weather. Health and well-being starts with us, and why depend on drugs when Mother Nature has given us enough to be in and spread good mood?",1633081836

PlantBasedDiet,How a Plant Based Diet helped me to fly!,"2016. I was eating anything and everything, no matter the animal, no matter the source. My options were diverse, but so were internal problems that were facing me. Cystic acne, lethargy, anxiety were all crippling me. Until one day, I had to temporarily stop eating dairy as I was on acne antibiotics. Little did I know that this was a blessing in disguise! I had more energy and was feeling a lot less lethargic; very much like increasing the video quality of a YouTube video! Within 2 years, I made the transition to plant based eating and I haven’t looked back since! Here are some of the benefits that I’ve harnessed with plant based eating.

**Better physical performance:** Being a sports and fitness fan, the differences in my performances before and after this diet is like night and day. My endurance has increased tenfold, I feel stronger and I am a lot more injury free. This is because dairy and meat products can increase inflammation in the body and joints, leaving us more susceptible to injury. Also, I am better able to recover from gym sessions and playing football matches and I suspect this is a direct result of there being less inflammation in my body. It’s not just me, some of the best sports athletes in the world such as Lewis Hamilton and Virat Kohli all follow plant based diets.

**Greater focus:** As I feel less tired and lethargic in the morning, it has helped to stay more focused throughout the day even without the help of coffee. As a result, I am better able to focus on work tasks and I complete them to a higher standard.

**Greater sense of well being:** Overall, I just feel a greater sense of lightness within myself. According to studies, meat products are harder to digest and can lead to constipation. However, with a plant based diet, you’ll be getting more than enough fibre to ensure that this will never be a problem! With this lightness, I feel like I am more sensitive to food, as if my taste buds have become enhanced, better allowing me to enjoy the wide ranges of scrumptious plant based food that are available to me!

Transitioning to a plant based diet does not have to be immediate! Start by trying plant based options at restaurants, or having one plant based meal a week. The proof is in the pudding and I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to find out for themselves about these benefits! For it is truly accessible to everyone!

PlantBasedDiet,Is it okay to have 400 grams of carbs in one meal?,"21 M, 135 lbs

I used to be very underweight (120 lbs) due to a stomach condition. I started eating WFPB and discovered that I can tolerate food much better now, except it has to be low fat as well.

Most of my calories come from carbs. I started lifting weights a month or 2 ago, riding my bike multiple times a day, and walking for 1-3 hours a day.

I get very hungry due to all of this, and so I eat 200-400 grams of carbs in a single meal sometimes….

Is this okay?

I checked my blood sugar because I used to have issues with that when I was underweight but my blood sugar doesn’t go crazy after eating that many carbs. Could be because I exercise.

Nevertheless, is this okay?

PlantBasedDiet,Has anyone here lost a significant amount of weight through WFPB?,So I've been WFPB since November. In the time since I've lost about 95lbs. At the start it wasn't about weight loss specifically; I was 20 and felt like I had the body of a 50 year old. On top of that I needed something to help high bp and liver enzymes. Then one night while mindlessly scrolling youtube I found a 1hr lecture on WFPB and was sold. I threw out all my junk food and went to the store the next day with a vague idea of what to buy.,1632862943
PlantBasedDiet,Tired of “WFPB” recipes containing oil,"Was going to buy a great looking cookbook, then come to find out all the recipes use oil. It makes calculating calories a pain in the ass. (I am only allowed 1,200 for my weight loss as a petite female and it sucks.) 

I have never liked cooking with oil. It always felt strange to just add 200 useless calories and pure fat to an otherwise healthy meal. I would pick the breading off of my fried foods as a kid. I was thrilled when I learned this was *essentially* vegan food with no oil, it’s perfect. But finding recipes is aggravating.

Yes I can omit the oil, but I have to redo the caloric calculations and perhaps expect the recipe to turn out different. And on principle, why title your book claiming it is WFPB but then add oil in your recipes…",1632852039

Sibling had bloods taken, GP is on holiday and so we're curious and making our way through the results. They've been plant based for a while (couple of years) now. Their hs-c reactive protein came back as &lt;4mg/L. Read this: [https://labtestsonline.org/tests/high-sensitivity-c-reactive-protein-hs-crp](https://labtestsonline.org/tests/high-sensitivity-c-reactive-protein-hs-crp) which seems to indicate that they're at high risk of heart/cardiovascular disease according to these results.   


It looks like everything else is fine from what we can see. How concerned should we be?   


This community has been really supportive and helpful, hoping someone here with better knowledge than me can point us in the right direction.

PlantBasedDiet,"Small plant-based success story - much less anxiety about ""gross""","I find it is so much less stress of eating now, since becoming plant-based/vegan. I have always been an extremely squeamish person around bodies/biological stuff/secretions/fluids, so when I was omnivore I ate in constant anxiety if I will find a fishbone or some gross tendon or other ""chewy"" part in my food, and just thinking for a moment about where milk product or egg came from made me want to gag, so I had to fight these reflexes nonstop to get through any meal.

Now to add to the list of things I don't have to worry about are - finding potential bones/tendons/hard parts/weird body part chunks in my food (even fking meat burger patties would consistently have some hard/chewy disgusting parts); much less need to worry about food being undercooked or the particularly awful parasites found in meat/fish; no need to look into the whole diet/lifestyle of the animal to determine whether they are really grassfed, how much stress they have, if they get any hormone or antibiotic injections, etc. to determine if their dairy has good nutritional composition. 

Somehow plant stuff, even if there are other risk like pesticides/mold involved, just seems to have so much less ""wet and gross and biological body-parts hormones secretions sticky gore"" involved. So it is much easier now to just eat and not worry (although there is some worry about dead bugs, have found these occasionally).

PlantBasedDiet,Optimal Blood Test number ranges (vegan athletes please add your numbers to this!),"Hi guys, I'm just kinda summarizing all of the tests I've ever seen posted online, plus my own info. **Please add your own numbers below! I'm looking for blood numbers from vegan low-fat athletes who rarely eat vegan junk foods and usually eat unprocessed whole foods.**      
What I hate about doctors is that they only inform you about what it takes to stay out of *""I need to give you drugs""* territory. They're not giving you what's optimal and peak performance for your body.

**What I've seen on most blood tests posted by vegans:**  

**BMI:** 19-22 is usually optimal. But &lt;25 at least, unless you're a bodybuilder. 

**Blood pressure:** 100/60 or 90/55 seems common in vegan athletes. But as long as you're 120/80 or lower, you're fine.      
**Fasting blood sugar:** most vegan athletes float around 70-90-ish.    

**Total cholesterol:** 150 or lower is best. Most vegans seem to float around 110-130.     
**LDL:** Seems like most vegans float around 40-60-ish     
**HDL:** Seems like most vegans float around 60-80-ish     
**Triglycerides:** seems like most vegans float around 50-60-ish   

**Standards doctors use to declare you ""healthy""** *(or aka the doctor can't give you drugs to make money off of you)***:**     
&lt;25 BMI      
&lt;200 Total cholesterol      
&lt;100 LDL     
\&gt;60 HDL     
&lt;150 triglycerides     
&lt;100 fasting blood sugar     
&lt;120/80 blood pressure   

**What the standards probably should be if we want ""optimal"" health:**     
&lt;23 BMI *(more wiggle room if you're some kind of serious weightlifter)*     
&lt;150 Total cholesterol     
&lt;70 LDL      
\&gt;60 HDL *(the only doctor's standard that I think is probably OK.)*      
&lt;70 triglycerides     
&lt;100 fasting blood sugar *(I think this standard is OK too.)*

I'm looking for WFPB alternatives to pasta. The majority of my diet is WFPB, but I still eat pasta a couple of times a week.
I could substitute it with shredded veggies, but I need something that will provide enough healthy carbs so I can maintain (and ideally increase) my weight. 
I already get enough protein, fibre and vitamins from my diet so no concerns there, I just need to substitute in healthier carbs. 

I also eat quite a lot of lentils, brown rice and wild rice but these don't quite go with an arrabiata-type pasta sauce.

However, in [this video](https://youtu.be/gcUXMW0sWBA) about muscle gain, the speaker recommends shooting for .3g/lb of bodyweight.

By the first calculation, I would be consuming approximately 320 calories of fat (~36g), based on my approximate BMR. But by the second one, I would be at 486 calories (~54g) because I weigh 180lbs right now. Following the 10% rule, I don’t think I could consume nearly 5k calories of mostly carbs and fiber. What should I do?

I have gone from a plant-based whole foods diet, then to vegetarian/vegan, and somewhere along this process I found that I have completely lost my sugar cravings. I have been addicted to sugar/sweets my entire life in a major way, and until now not a single diet or way of eating has helped to reduce them - not even keto, which is famous for getting rid of sugar cravings. However on a plant-based diet, I haven't even noticed, but I never have any desire for sweets anymore - regardless of satiety.

I'm wondering if this has been the case for anyone else, or if anyone might know the mechanism for this? My first thought would be gut bacteria/microbiota changing from all the plant foods, but would love to hear otherwise, if someone knows better :)",1632013593

Although I'm eating good and filling foods, I just sometimes can't get over the craving of sugary and fatty foods (like chips, fries etc) 

I'm pretty new to plantbased as well, and I previously didn't consume dairy often due to me being lactose intolerant, but I sometimes really crave it now.

I'd love to cut out sugar completely someday (except for fruits etc, obviously), has anyone successfully done this? Maybe even with a similar disorder?

(One thing I am doing is drinking an energy drink from time to time to fight the cravings, since it's sweet as well. It's technically vegan and even low sugar, but it's obviously processed and they're just using an sugar alternative.)",1631890126

PlantBasedDiet,Don’t know if you can say gregor’s way is objectively the best,"I realize coming to this forum to say this is kind of contrarian and lame but I am curious as to if any of the things I’m saying have effectively been debunked. Genuinely open and welcome to being proven wrong. I honestly believe that the dr Gregor crowd and whole food plant based purists out there are kind of off as to what is the perfectly optimal diet. It’s a safe bet to look at all the research and only eat the stuff that isn’t associated with health risks under the most context but foods are meant to work in conjunction with eachother. Yeah if you eat meat without any of the foods that protect against and mitigate the draw backs of eating meat you’ll probably have a bad time. But there are studies Gregor himself points to that show that eating things like blue berries and spinach before even the unhealthiest high fat McDonald’s meal can almost completely mitigate biological markers for artery damage or whatever. There are compounds in meat like certain omega 6 fats that are associated with great health benefits that cannot be found at all in plant foods. And some non plant foods are just kind of ridiculously nutritious. Shell fish are some of the most nutrient dense foods on earth… especially in b12… a vitamin you can’t get from plants (not sure that bacteria argument has been sufficiently proven, either way a pill certainly qualifies as a processed food!) If you can avoid stuff like added hormones and other unnatural processing of these foods I think there is insufficient evidence to say that adding them to you diet in small amounts in conjunction with protective foods would come with significant health risks. I think it’s also somewhat dishonest to say that eating a whole food plant based diet comes with no draw backs. A lot of these foods are hard to digest, contain anti nutrients, and things like oxalates which come with known health risks. I’m not knocking eating this way. There are moral and environmental reasons for eating like this I stand by, but I’m not sure it’s perfectly optimal. Pretty optimal but not any more so than the above changes to this diet I outlined.",1631863543

PlantBasedDiet,What are your solutions for tasty meals?,"Recently I've been struggling with both [covering all my bases in terms of nutrient consumption](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/) on a no oil vegan diet and enjoy the taste. Often I will eat a meal I created (pasta with lentils and veggies for example) and feel entirely unsatisfied emotionally despite feeling full.

(I should mention I have binge eating disorder so eating for emotional reasons is a huge issue. I'm working to ""treat"" this but no treatment approach I've found or discussed with therapists addresses this particular issue).  


So, after a few days, I feel emotionally run down and will binge on something unhealthy but tastier (vegan junk food with added sugar/salt/oil). Or, I will stick to the few meals I do enjoy (oatmeal and lentils 3 times a day) but over time I feel unwell because they are limiting my nutrition intake

I am very new to a plant based diet. My partner &amp; I recently made the switch &amp; we are both really enjoying it so far. My only issue is that my period is now MIA. It’s technically speaking 9 days late. I say technically because I have irregular periods. My longest cycle i have ever had was 42 days. I am now on day 44 but my period was due 9 days ago. I have booked a doctors appointment but it’s not for ages due to the NHS backlog. I was wondering if any of you guys have experience this when you first made the transition. I will admit that before making the change I did consume a lot of semi-skimmed milk due to having a huge coffee addiction. I am thinking that maybe my body is confused by the lack of all the hormones that are found in cows milk. I am not with child (have tested twice just to be absolutely sure &amp; I am also someone who has been told by doctors that I will need IVF to conceive so I knew when testing it would be highly unlikely that I would get anything other than a negative result)

So I’ve technically already had my serving of nuts for the day and won’t have the handful at night. Is this the wrong way to do WFPB?

skin problems like dandruff, psoriasis, peeling skin etc.

I've never had any food allergies, but for the past 2 or 3 years, I've been reacting increasingly worse to certain foods. Especially dairy, gluten (brother has severe celiac disease, was never tested myself), and almost every meat besides Chicken atm. Rice and soy also don't like me very much.

Just yesterday and today I experienced it again. Yesterday I ate a chocolate bar, and within 20 minutes my body had a small meltdown. Today I ate some sausages and within half an hour I had severe stomach pain and diarrhea.

I've been thinking about it for a while, but now I'm very seriously considering only consuming fruits, veggies, nuts, chicken and eggs (that's the mostly plant-based part, for now I want to keep it in, because I can't imagine just completely switching everything out at once, tips are still greatly appreciated for when I actually switch them out for a purely plant-based protein source)

I've read a bit about it, but I figured first hand experience would be the best advice I could get.

So, my main question is, is this realistic and doable in the long run? I only plan to eat the things I listed, no flour, pasta, rice, soy or anything alike. What are possible risks, like malnourishment etc.? What are the costs?

-Next step is the best: mash it all up together with a fork!

PlantBasedDiet,"Sight worsening, SO blames my diet. What have you seen?","Been on a plants only diet since 1/1/2019 without cheating. I take vegan multi vitamins but not nearly as frequent as I should. 

I had noticeably great vision. I could read distant signs on command. My nearsight was just as crisp. It has been my super power.

But over the past month it’s slowly getting worse. Both distance and close objects started to blur. Today it got really bad! I am struggling to read as I type for instance. Super scary.

I told my wife today about my vision loss. She immediately blamed it on my diet. My Google search resulted in a mixed bag. Some say vitamin B12 deficiency is common in vegans and can result in vision loss.  Some say my diet should increase my vision. My plant based vitamins have 1000% daily b12. Also I’m under the impression that b12 last a long time in your body.

I will be choosing a primary care doctor tomorrow - I never feel the need to see a doctor. I’m in my late 30s. I also will be breaking my diet today by buying b12 pills that are not vegan.

Has anyone else started getting blurry vision after a couple years on the diet? Or know any thing that I should know?

Thanks.",1630531034

Well the reason why I had to go on a hiatus when I was about 11 yrs old… well I was showing signs of being able to eat eggs and meat without having to run to the bathroom (that’s returned), not throwing up due to my gag reflex picking up on canned fish(no bananas-texture,honeydew, or musk melon they just make nauseous from the smell) and having younger siblings. Well I’m coming back to this diet, because it’s technically the only diet that I was able to deal with… well now I have to feed my younger siblings and they are NOT fan of savory breakfast foods and one can’t have maple syrup (they’re *extremely* allergic to Maple trees and by-proxy the very popular sap) and we will gladly take any carob recipes (same kiddo, but they bounce off the walls from caffeine,soda,chocolate, and super-sugary sweets and snack foods)",1630519723

PlantBasedDiet,Nutrition Boosting Prep Tips List,"Hi folks,  


I've come across some interesting things you can do to boost nutrition for various foods and I'm on the search for more that I haven't heard of yet. Thought I'd share what I've come across, see if ya'll can contribute any, and then I'll make some sort of list/graphic to share once I compile them all.   


Here's what I've got so far:  


* Pre-chop cruciferous vegetables to boost sulforaphane production
   * Sulforaphane is a beneficial phytonutrient found in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, collards, or cauliflower). Sulforaphane is created via a reaction triggered by chopping the vegetable. To maximize sulforaphane production, chop cruciferous vegetables 40 minutes before cooking. If frozen, this strategy will not work, but you can still boost sulforaphane production by adding some mustard powder to trigger the reaction.
   * Reference: [https://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/](https://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/)
* Pre-chop or crush garlic to boost artery relaxing compounds
   * Garlic creates artery relaxing compounds via a reaction triggered by cutting or crushing it. To maximize production of these compounds, cut or crush the garlic ten minutes before cooking it.
   * Reference: [https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-onions/](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-onions/)
* Black pepper boosts turmeric absorption
   * Adding black pepper to dishes containing turmeric can boost the absorption of the turmeric phytonutrient curcumin by 2000%.

England are currently low on blood test vials and my scheduled test for vitamin levels is no longer going ahead as I do not qualify as urgent. 

I am therefore hoping to get some advice from any of you who may be experienced with vitamin deficiencies. 

B12 is not an issue (I have pernicious anaemia so get a three monthly jab to keep that high) but I am not sure what other vitamins/minerals I could be running low on. 

I’ve been vegetarian nearly two years and have recently been making more steps towards completely plant based. I’ve swapped out dairy and limit egg intake too, there are just a couple little steps left to go. 

Taking tablets doesn’t really work for me. I’ve tried and I just end up not doing it as taking my medication is already enough to swallow each day and I can’t deal. So anything I might be low in I would appreciate ways I can better absorb through my diet please. 

I am very fatigued most days. I also struggle with low mood and concentration on and off. My body is quite weak, even if I feel strong temporarily while exercising, I am just too fatigued most days to do more than the minimum. 

I’ve discussed it with my doctor and he is certain it’s a vitamin issue, but obviously can’t test me anytime soon to find out which one. Hence asking for your lovely opinions!

I stumbled upon this great subreddit when I was looking to drastically change my diet up. I won't bore you with endless details but in a nutshell - I was keto/lowcarb for about 9 years and have always been very active in the gym with powerlifting and strongman. I ended up at about 130kg (286lbs) at 6"" and was dreadfully unhealthy. The whole keto/carnivore/lowcarb/justeatbacon method wasn't working and it was just an excuse to eat like a pig. So, the good news is that in a month im down 5kg and I've noticed a few things:

1. inflammation. it's gone! I used to blame those pesky carbs for bloating me up but looks like it was the meat. any links to this?
2. mood. I am calm, focused and have balanced energy. I seemed to live on the edge with constant anxiety whilst on a meat based diet - is this a drop in cortisol and a boost in serotonin from the carbs?
3. No bloating. what is going on? I assume that all these lovely plants have done wonders for my gut as I feel lighter and healthier. I'm gonna take a punt and say fibre! why is this wonderful nutrient ignored so much?

So overall, This is ace. Feel better, look better and the benefits so far are showing. who would of thought that eating what's natural to use would be so good for us... I feel like a dummy for following such odd eating habits before.

I tried last year to quit meat cold turkey after I saw some documentaries, mostly for ethical reasons. I am very interested in nutrition and I feel that the evidence for a plant based diet is mixed (this is my own, non qualified opinion. I fully understand that people in this sub may think differently). 

  
The first time I quit meat I didn't put much effort in constructing a meal plan and tracking macros. As a result, I made all the common mistakes (not eating enough calories, too much fibers) and it didn't work out for me. I would like to try again in a more conscious way. I read quite a bit about plant based nutrition, I feel that I know that there are some things that I may have to supplements. I also use Cronometer already to track my macros and micros so hopefully I should be able to spot obvious mistakes/deficencies.

I am quite obsessed about health and longevity so I would like to check up my values now and after a bit that I eat a plant based diet (3 months would be a good time?) to see from an objective point of view if it is improving my health markers etc. 

I live in England and my understanding is that my GP would prescribe blood tests only if necessary. I am happy to pay for this by myself privately but I am not sure on what should I focus on and if there are providers that offer some kind of packages with all the most important things to check.",1629920301

PlantBasedDiet,Need Advice for a Keto to WFPB Transition,"Hi everyone! I recently have been quite surprised after I have been reading How to Not Die by Michael Greger, and have increasingly realized that I do not nearly get enough vegetables or fruits in my diet (haha.. eggs and bacon). It has been very eye opening for me.

  
I'm currently a 22 y/o male and do not need to lose any more weight. I am actually able to maintain my weight fine, but gaining is the hard part. I believe a plant-based/Vegan diet would be more beneficial in the long run for me, and I have enjoyed it in the past. I do better with no dairy as well, so that is a plus.

Does anyone, who has made the switch before or haven't, have any advice on going from a ketogenic state to adapting to the higher carbs? I'd like to limit the bodily stress from the eating change as much as I can, and stick with it as well.

I would greatly appreciate some tips that would make maintaining and gaining weight on this diet/vegan easier. Any recommended resources are helpful.

""When we look at the three most proinflammatory components, they are present in high caloric products; such as butter or margarine, pastries and sweets, fried snacks, and red or processed meat.""

""As diet is a modifiable risk factor, we can actually do something about it. If we take a closer look at five components of the DII ( dietary inflammatory index), which are most anti-inflammatory, these components are present in green leafy vegetables, vegetables, fruit, soy, whole grains, and green and black tea.

And its frustrating because i feel like my ego comes in because of all the propaganda to do with plant based not working. Because ive seen some people thrive on it and some people just look very nutritionally deficient. So any advice on the best people to watch what supplements i should be taking. Because everytime i eat diary, meat or fish i acc just become really down. I do believe in the transferring of energy with food and im interested in consuming mainly from nature.

PlantBasedDiet,Teenager wants to go plant based,"Hey y’all! 
I’ve been fascinated with plant based lifestyles for quite a while, and recently I have felt the urge to really adopt it, especially knowing the health benefits, the athletic benefits, and the fact that it’s more ethical. 

The thing is, I’ve asked my mum if I could go vegan, but she keeps trying to ignore my requests… 

One thing though, my mum has been going off to see a man, so I’m often living on my own or at my uncles, and often she gives me pocket money to buy myself essentials and what not.. 

With this money I’ve tried going grocery shopping, I got a few ingredients but not many, since I’m limited to my bike, but I constantly find myself making the same old recipes. What I have trouble with is buying efficiently and making meals out of all the food I buy (hoping it can last me more than a week) 

I am also quite busy all the time with my sport so I don’t have all the time to also cook amazing meals, right now it has come to me preparing a big batch of rice and then adding some frozen vegetables to it… 

My mum says find a recipe and buy the ingredients for that, but I always feel like that’s such a waste and inefficient, and so I don’t know what to get in my situation. 

I don’t know how to cook well yet too.. 


This is the stuff I have right now, maybe there are some suggestions as to what I could add? 

- 2 things of hummus 
- 1 bunch of celery 
- 2 cartons of almond milk 
- 2 little boxes of mushrooms 
- a bag of frozen mixed peas, corn, etc 
- a bag of frozen Italian blend veggies 
- a bag of frozen berries 
- some whole wheat tortillas 
- a bag of avocados 
- a tub of cherry tomatoes 
-2 cans of chickpeas 
- can of mixed beans 
- bag of quinoa 
- bag of brown basmati rice 
- peanut butter 
- bag of red lentils 
- some whole grain macaroni 

And I think that’s it. 
I know it’s probably a lot, I just have trouble constructing things, and I’ll look up recipes and the recipe will require more ingredients than I have, and it’s just frustrating I can’t bike all the time to the store, and I don’t have infinite money. 

Idk if y’all know any simple recipes I could start out with, with these ingredients?

I joined a gym solely for the purpose of gaining muscle. This is a privately owned gym which does all forms of training. On the first day, the owner and operator who is also a trainer, talked to me. **BEFORE** he asked me what I eat, have any allergies or what my eating regimen was, he gave me a run down of things to **completely** get rid of in my diet. I thought it was pretty strange, because, other than sugar, I have never heard any of the other claims. Then he emailed me that information so I can reference it. I talked to my family doctor - who knows my health very well - and she said his nutrition guide sounded like alarmist bullshit. 

He says in order to gain muscle, you have to get rid of Soy, Dairy, Sugar, Gluten and Corn. 

Why? Because it makes your muscles inflamed. And inflamed muscles slow your gains progress. That was the jist of it.

PlantBasedDiet,Study: 800 grams of Fruits and Vegetables a Day Correlated with Reduced Mortality from All Causes,"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/3/1029/3039477

This is about a large dinner plate of whole fruits, vegetables, mushrooms and legumes (leafy greens need a different measurement as they weigh less).

&gt; Similar associations were observed for fruits and vegetables separately. Reductions in risk were observed up to 800 g/day for all outcomes except cancer (600 g/day). Inverse associations were observed between the intake of apples and pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and salads and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of green-yellow vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total cancer risk. An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million premature deaths worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively, if the observed associations are causal.

PlantBasedDiet,"How to get 160 g protein and 3000 calories on a WFPB bodybuilding diet (high protein, high calorie)"," The idea is to follow a daily high-protein goal and weekly calorie goal (21,000 kcal). This should be easy after following a daily ""shell"", constant staple foods, of about 100 g protein (including 40 g protein powder) and 1500 calories. This way, all one needs to do is count the calories and protein from lunch and dinner (instead of everything every day). Why? This is for weight-gain and bodybuilding. 

By ""shell"" I mean a morning snack, afternoon snack, evening snack and drinks. 

* 600 calorie breakfast
   * 20 g protein
* Ideally, 275 calorie peanut butter apple, morning snack
   * 7.5 g
* lunch
* Ideally, 250 calories 1/4 cup almonds + 7 apricot halves, afternoon snack
* dinner
* Ideally, 380 calories 1/2 cup walnut/ pecan night snack
   * 14.5 g (including almonds+apricots from the afternoon) 

600+275+250+380

\~= 1500 kcal

Drinks

* ~~120 OJ, 1 cup~~
* 250 soymilk, 2.5 cups
   * 17.5 g protein
* ~~150 grape juice, 1 cup~~
* ~~130 vanilla protein powder, 1 serving~~
* ~~150 chocolate protein powder, 1 serving~~

By only using the foods accepted on a WFPB diet, the shell equals 1750 calories and 59.5 g protein (vs 2300 calories and 102.5 g protein). So 550 calories and 43 g protein difference from the juice and protein powder. 

For a 3000 calorie, 160 g protein diet, this would mean lunch and dinner would have to be an average of 625 calories each. It's possible, but challenging to get that many calories (excluding the drink). 

Say one's daily protein goal is 160 g. That means, a 29 g protein average for each lunch and dinner would have to be bumped up to \~**50 g** protein per meal. Now that's a stretch. Most meals are 10-30 g protein. 

# Solutions

→ larger breakfast (e.g., 1444 calorie smoothie)

→ sip some blended drink throughout the day: for example, a 30 g protein soy milk perhaps with quinoa blended together

→ different/larger morning, afternoon and evening snacks equaling 52 g protein total

→ \~2 cups of soymilk more for breakfast and \~2 cups more for dinner (or lunch)

\--- --- --- 

After the WFPB high-protein high-calorie shell is figured out, I'll try to make one for nut free, soy free, gluten free, keto friendly and maybe IBS friendly. 

\--- --- ---

(Also, side note, why are seitan posts allowed here but not posts with a minimal amount of juice? I don't understand that inconsistency.)

\--- --- ---

Why 160 g daily protein goal? 

*  ""two days after their last resistance-training session, amateur male bodybuilders required 1.7–2.2 g/kg.[\[17\]](https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/#ref17)""
* [r/ScientificNutrition/comments/mmwjpx/dietary\_intake\_of\_competitive\_bodybuilders\_2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/mmwjpx/dietary_intake_of_competitive_bodybuilders_2015/)

PlantBasedDiet,Getting frequent headaches. Is it potentially diet-related?,"I'll try to succinctly provide as much info as I can.

* Vegan diet for about 3 weeks, but not 100% WFPB (mostly just a bit of oil, white rice, etc.)

* Drink about a gallon of water a day (I'm 5'8, 186lbs)

* I eat quite a bit of peanut butter, avocado, and sourdough/ezekiel bread, so I think I'm good on calories. I also eat plenty of other carbs (beans, lentils, chickpea/lentil pasta, rice), and a lot of veggies. I basically eat when I'm hungry and don't worry about over-eating.

I'm going to start logging my food and doing Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen app, so I don't have data ready to go, but for today, for example:

* 6:45am - ate breakfast bowl: 1 can beans, 1 red bell pepper, 1/2 cup shredded potato, 1/4 cup frozen corn, maybe 1/3 cup cherry tomatoes, 2oz avocado. Also drank a glass of water (10-12oz). 

* 7:00am - iced coffee with oat milk (nothing else added to it)

* 8:00-9:00am - cup of black coffee and about 16oz of water

* 9:45am - headache coming on",1629214505
PlantBasedDiet,Need Help Food Prepping for Two—Any Freezable Suggestions?,"Heyo Reddit! My mom broke her ankle and sprained her other one on Saturday. She has my dad for help, but I’ve moved home for the week to be an extra set of hands to get her adjusted. My main focus this week is making as much freezable food as possible so my dad, who came from a “only women cook/clean” household and never challenged those views, can reheat them for dinners.

My entire family has only very recently started to transition to the plant-based lifestyle, and I’ve been able to make all my meals as needed. Because of that, I don’t have any practice making plant-based meals that can be frozen. My mom is very nervous about not being able to continue on with the transition to plant-based due to relying on my dad for dinner, so I want to make sure that’s one less thing on her mind right now.

So—what are your favorite freezable meals? Bonus points if they’re on the cheaper side!

PlantBasedDiet,New here! Looking for specific resources (look inside),"TL;DR: New here, always struggled with cooking, looking for guidance to find resources that help with cooking in one day for the whole week, and teaches on how to make the process itself more efficient (the more details the better). My goal is to become independent

Hello there, im excited as i just met this subreddit a few hours and have been looking at posts very motivated.

From what i was able to rescue, im planning on buying the books Eat for Health and How not to die.

The issue is my habit and mentality when cooking, my mind is very structured and i always have hard time cooking unless i know all the details (for example if i dont know if i have to boil the water for 5 minutes or 8 minutes, i kind of collapse).

Thats why i found a way of life that works for me, as im trying my best to be independent. This is making a “life manual”. So here i will be filling things like amount of items to buy each week, where to buy them, which meals i know how to cook, etc.

So the reasons of me coming here today are two: 
1) i want to get better and have a healthier lifestyle, as i have ulcerative colitis, migraines and bipolars type I.

2) I want to ask the community for some guidance. The only way for me to learn, is by being a geek as i always am :) that means trying to optimize everything. My dream would be to have a resource that teaches me specifically how to cook in one day for the whole week, teaching the method of how to do the processes in parallel, and the very details including the minimal ones on the meal cooking itself.

I believe that a resource like this will motivate me a lot, because the ups and downs of everyday life sometimes make it hard to keep a daily routine of cooking. I know this about myself, and have been in that place where i barely take care of myself and end up skipping meals, which triggers a whole lot of other negative symptoms

Anything that i missed please let me know, at the moment i can’t think of more details of what i need, and this is very important to me as its the last step needed to become independent in my life.",1629205942

PlantBasedDiet,Beyond Meat: The Sustainable Food Company Revolutionizing How the World Produces and Consumes Protein,"Plant-based meat is the future of protein.  With the climate crisis growing in severity with every passing day, the need for innovative new products in this category only increases.  Beyond Meat is the leader in plant-based protein, and is revolutionizing how the world eats meat.

The vast majority of agriculture production goes to feeding animals for human consumption. If we can cut out the ""middle man"", and simply produce protein directly from plants, why cause all the destruction, suffering, and carbon emissions? This is essentially what Beyond Meat has done, utilizing mainly peas as well as some other plants in order to make tasty, basically identical meat alternatives. This is an innovation the world desperately needs, as protein demand is increasing globally and vital resources such as cropland and water are becoming more constrained.

I made a podcast myself to dive deep into this crisis, and how Beyond Meat is helping solve it. We must attack Climate Change from all fronts, and Beyond Meat is helping lead the charge from the sustainable food side. I don't get any money or compensation for all this research and work, and if you don't want to listen I understand. Just thought I'd spread what I know and help inspire those to action that desire it.

 Listen in to discover the breakthrough innovations Beyond Meat has engineered, and how they're going to change the world as a result.

I've tried freezing it and that seems to work the most but even then sometimes it just gets soft again into a mess as I cook it. Baking it seems to just turn it into some sort of weird jerky consistency.

PlantBasedDiet,"oil-free, nut-free and avocado-free dressing ideas?!","I've mostly relied on avocados, seeds, oil free hummus and tahini dressing for my source of healthy fats. Lately I've gotten a bit tired of tahini dressing though. Also, since about 2 weeks back I have sadly noticed that my throat starts itching when I eat avocado all of a sudden :(

Since I'm allergic to nuts and want to be as oil free as possible, I don't know what to use as my healthy fat source anymore? I mean, hummus don't go with everything like avocado does and I'll probably get tired of it if I start eating that every day. And as I said I'm getting tired of tahini dressing already. Sure, you can always sprinkle your food with seeds, but when you want some moisture to your food I'd rather have a dressing in place of the mashed avocado I can't eat right now.

PlantBasedDiet,[Recipe] Ultra Lazy - Ultra Quick - WFPB Chili,"So...I am not WFPB yet, but I am experimenting with various whole food recipes that are easy.  Easy recipes make it easy to stick to it.  

One of my favorite recipes is Chili.  I figured out a ultra lazy, ultra quick method to make WFPB chili.  

(No pictures….but it’s Chili!)

Recipe:

2 cans of your bean of choice – I used 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans
1 jar of mild/medium/hot salsa – Most salsas seem to be basic whole foods and spices
1 can of mushroom chunks (substitutes for meatiness in non-WFPB chili)
1 can Corn
1 package of Chili seasoning – your preference, but I chose Williams Chili seasoning 


Instructions:

1.  Rinse beans, mushrooms, and corn under running water in a strainer
2.  Add salsa and chili seasoning (half package of Williams, in my case).
3.  Portion out and microwave a portion for 3 minutes.
4.  Store the rest in the refrigerator.

This took me no more than 10 minutes, including cleanup, and it is an excellent substitute for meaty chili.  Enjoy!

Note:  You may think it’s a good idea to add the whole chili seasoning package, but it is NOT, unless you just REALLY like gritty chili.",1628973189

So, to keep it short. I'm a 23yo male pushing 350 (342 last I checked a couple days ago). DEFINITELY not healthy. A few years ago, I was able to go from 350lb to 220lb (130lb loss) within a year by eating 1600 calories a day and working out three times a day, six days a week. Looking back on that, sure, it was great to lose the weight. But I didn't do it in the healthiest of ways (working out at an almost obsessive amount, not eating enough calories, etc.) 

With that said, I've gained all the weight back and NEED to get my life back on track. I had to get my gallbladder taken out a couple months ago and then I was told I also have a fatty liver. I don't want to cut my life short due to terrible eating.

PlantBasedDiet,Taiwanese Cabbage Stew,"The full recipe and details :  
[https://joyfuldumplings.com/taiwanese-cabbage-stew/](https://joyfuldumplings.com/taiwanese-cabbage-stew/?fbclid=IwAR3BkKiFWJWeQ2X1kIKxV6orvuDtUGRUuJJpHQ2t4CPnUQ_bwRVNX9BwkVk)

Taiwanese Cabbage Stew is probably one of the most underrated Taiwanese food due to Its look, so simple, plain, and has no fancy ingredients in it. However, I would say this Taiwanese Cabbage Stew indeed is just a very humble dish that is hiding in the streets, if you have ever tried it, I think you would totally agree with me. 

The Chinese cabbage in this dish is So so so Tender and naturally sweet, paired with Shiitake mushroom, the strong, earthy, and umami flavor. The Tofu Skin and Wood Ear mushroom give this cabbage stew some chewy and crunchy texture. However, Carrot plays a big role in giving this dish some contrast color. Taiwanese Cabbage Stew goes so well with steamed rice even noodles. Every time I go back to my hometown to visit my family, I'd never forgotten to spare some time to go to a restaurant, specifically order this dish and enjoy. 

Since I moved to Australia, I started my experiments on making Authentic Taiwanese food recipes, and this Vegan Taiwanese Cabbage Stew recipe is the best by far! Here I'm going to share with you!",1628679792

PlantBasedDiet,Brown Rice - Reducing the Arsenic and Phytic Acid,"I eat brown rice every day but when I was researching how to mitigate the antinutrients in beans and lentils, I discovered the antinutrient phytic acid is high in brown rice also. While researching that, I discovered the concern about high arsenic levels in rice, especially brown rice. After reading about all that, I searched for a way to cook brown rice to decrease both concerns and I think I've found it.

From an article on the website Health, you soak the rice overnight, boil it in 5 parts water to 1 part rice, and then rinse it again in hot water before serving. This reduced the arsenic content down to 18% of original amount. 

From the Whole Health Source blog, you can reduce the phytic acid content by 98% in the future, if you drain the rice the first time, keep 10% of the drained rice water and put that water in the refrigerator. The next time you soak some rice, add the drained water you kept in the refrigerator to the rice that's soaking. When you drain that batch of water, keep 10% of the water again and refrigerate it. Keep doing that and by the 3rd batch, you'll be removing 98% of the phytic acid from your rice. The refrigerated water contains high amounts of phytase as well as microorganisms that secrete phytase, which is necessary to break down the phytic acid in the rice.  

I'm also going to keep basmati rice from California, Pakistan, or India on hand in case I don't have time to do all that. White rice has less phytic acid because the bran is removed and basmati rice from California, Pakistan, and India was found to have low levels of arsenic. 

Just wanted to share my findings!",1628613191

PlantBasedDiet,I can’t believe I felt that bad before,"I am the oddball in the family who chose to explore different diets. I never felt particular great from eating the “amazing” food my heavily white pasta, animal balls, and dairy family ate.
It always seemed...weird. We all got together but ate what people kept claiming is amazing ... and then we were so damaged from it we all literally needed to run home to sleep it off.
But what hurt worse is that... I quickly realized I was ostracized by so many by wanting to I show up but just not out myself into a food coma.

At first I had to make excuses. Then I just gave up and began eating and telling others I changed for health, because they would never just leave it alone. I was called rude. I was told sleeping is a sign of it being so good the body needed to process it. I was yelled at . People literally caried I wouldn’t eat bacon ...and when I began vomiting from them sneaking it into my food I was being dramatic. 

Anyway. I switched diets. And I just began getting my life back. Food actually energized me. I felt good after eating. I could use the bathroom without a 30 min push session . I didn’t need to pop pills to get me through the day. 

A lot has happened in my life. But I was hanging with a decently good family member. I was willing to eat their non meat food . Just white pasta with police oil and fried eggplant . 

I just can’t believe how badly it made me feel. I walked into the house feeling good. I left with a wave of fatigue , headache coming on. I had to bail hanging out with a friend because I needed to vomit.

The other person I ate with immediately went to sleep after. But they claim that has nothing to do with the food. They are in denial.

I’m just shocked . I can’t believe how badly I use to feel. How did I live like that ? How does anyone have a life feeling like that all the time ?",1628566941

PlantBasedDiet,High Fiber Veg dishes wanted,"So I want to preface by saying I am extremely lucky- my 2.5 year old eats mostly everything given to him, and he really tries everything. We like to eat different cuisines, so he’s been exposed to a variety of types and eats mostly everything we give him.

The issue currently is that we have to up his fiber intake and probiotics. Our ped recommended using Culturelle, and limit carbs and starches, but I’d like to make it a dietary switch rather than rely on Culturelle if possible. We already eat plenty of fruit and yogurt, but I’m a bit stuck on vegetable dishes with fiber. 

The kids really like all type of yams and sweet potatoes- Japanese yams, purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, white, and also squashes- butternut, kambocha, pumpkins, etc. But they’re starchy, so I’ll be limiting them. 

I’m trying to find dishes or side dishes with good flavors, but I’d like them to be outside the normal roasted veg or ‘add cheese’ dish. I’d also like to look for veg dishes in other cuisines but am unsure where to look.

As an example of some veg that my kids will eat- hummus, falafel, bok choy, avocado and tomatoes salad, any kind of mushroom- shiitake, enoki, oyster; Japanese seaweed salad, pickles, sauerkraut are just a few different examples. 

Some things they don’t like- hard carrots (has to be soft, so no raw carrots), green beans, red peppers (I think the skin is what they don’t like). Also, spicy foods- spices is fine, but nothing spicy hot. 

I’m thinking of making chia seed pudding as a way to increase fiber as well. But if anyone has any good vegetable recipes they can share, or how they adjusted meals to increase fiber intake that would be great. TIA.",1628435830

PlantBasedDiet,"Blood Panel, Pleasantly Surprised!","I moved to a whole food plant based diet with the help of this sub five years ago and it transformed my life. I feel good, I look good, I eat for super cheap, and I thoroughly enjoy trying new recipes I stumble on!

I recently saw a doctor for the first time in *years* for some other issues, and in the process she brought up ""oh you haven't had a blood panel in 20 years and you're nearing 40 years old? Let's do that!""

The initial tests, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Complete Blood Count, came back all within range save for my blood glucose which came in at 108mg/dl, with a 65-99 the desired range. I did some looking into it and attributed it to my morning coffee that day, the initial CMP and CBC weren't fasting blood tests, so naturally I had my normal routine cup of coffee getting ready that day. At the doctor's recommendation to verify that glucose is fine, I followed up with a fasting A1c test and Lipid Panel and was just *blown away* with the results! The doctor sent me a message with my results ""keep up the good work!"" Very satisfying and validating to hear that, to *know* I'm doing the right thing.

I knew eating this way made me feel good, I'd heard the science and peer-reviewed studies from Dr. Greger - I love watching his videos, sometimes I'll put them on to relax and get ready to sleep - but I hadn't actually... put it to the (blood) test, unnntil now!

&gt; Total Cholesterol 109
&gt; 
&gt; HDL 41
&gt; 
&gt; Triglycerides 73
&gt; 
&gt; LDL 53
&gt; 
&gt; CHOL/HDLC Ratio 2.7
&gt; 
&gt; Non-HDL Cholesterol 68
&gt; 
&gt; Hemoglobin A1c 4.7
    
I had a separate blood pressure read the day before the A1c and Lipid tests, and that came in at 113/71. That was actually a little *high* for me, as my past 3 reads over the previous 12 months have been 105/63, 109/58, and 104/65. Regardless, it's still a great place to be! I attribute it to having been on vacation for a week and not getting my 10k steps in every single day, spending more time experimenting with my new waffle maker, making tons of banana oat waffles and hash browns. Gotta treat yourself every now and then!

Beans and quinoa and vegetables every single day, cooked at home. Flax and chia and black cumin once a day in a glass of water before meal. 2-4 tbsp unsalted sunflower kernels. Usually for dessert a banana or three, an apple, and often a grapefruit, though sometimes I make nice cream from frozen bananas, sometimes oatmeal banana cookies, cinnamon apples, all sorts of tasty treats!

I wish somebody had told me about this lifestyle sooner. I wish *more people knew about it!* To think of all the preventable diseases and pains and heartache caused by eating the Standard American Diet, to see it all around us all the time, to *know* what salt and sugar and oil and meat and dairy do to our bodies and to have everyone around us *willfully* indulging despite the risks... it's madness.

Fiber is your friend, don't toss it out! Wall off your calories, eat plants whose cell walls have to be broken down to access the goodies inside, don't eat a bunch of processed vegan junk food, imitation meats and smoothies.

If this post does nothing else, I hope at least one person can see this and be willing to try it, to put it to the test, to take control of their lives and their bodies with this *all so simple* and easy way of living.",1628142118

This is a fairly common mixture, from what I hear.

But then I took it a bit further. I added [kaniwa](https://nuts.com/cookingbaking/grains/kaniwa.html), [amaranth](https://nuts.com/cookingbaking/grains/amaranth/organic/1lb.html), and [millet](https://nuts.com/cookingbaking/grains/millet/organic/1lb.html). I also started soaking my grains before cooking them, usually for about 24 hours. If you go longer, you'll actually start slightly fermenting the grains, which will introduce subtle flavors (which I personally love). If you pre-soak the grain, you can use slightly less water when cooking in a rice cooker: I fill up to 3 or 3.5 for 2 cups of grain.

Nowadays, I simply can't go back to unsoaked plain brown rice — I just find that the slight fermentation and mixture of grains introduces many additional flavors and textures into the mix that just take the grain to another level.",1628053808

½ large (1½- to 2 lb) head cauliflower, broken into florets  
2 teaspoons vegan butter (soy-free if  
necessary)  
8 ounces cremini mushrooms (or button mushrooms), sliced  
2 teaspoons liquid aminos (or gluten- free tamari; use coconut aminos to be soy-free)  
½ cup raw cashews (if you don’t have a high-speed blender, soak in warm water for at least 30 minutes and drain; discard the water)  
1 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk (soy-free if necessary)  
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast  
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder (or cornstarch)  
1 teaspoon dried thyme  
½ teaspoon garlic powder  
½ teaspoon salt

👉 HOW TO DO

Place the cauliflower in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water and cover. Steam the cauliflower until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and liquid aminos and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Combine the steamed cauliflower, cashews, milk, nutritional yeast, arrowroot powder, thyme, garlic powder, and salt in a blender and blend until smooth. Add the mushrooms (and if desired, their cooking liquid) and pulse until they’re in small bits incorporated throughout. You can use the soup right away in a recipe.

If you are not using it right away, let it cool completely before transferring to an airtight container. The soup will keep for 5 to 7 days in the fridge or 2 months in the freezer. If you freeze it, let it thaw completely before using.

👉 VARIATION

Turn this into the type of soup you eat in a bowl (novel idea, I know, but settle down, casserole lover): Combine the soup with 2 cups water or low-sodium vegetable broth in a pot and heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through",1627915480

PlantBasedDiet,Need advice on evening snack routine,"So, to start off I just want to say full disclosure I am not vegan right now or vegetarian for that matter. I want to try a vegan diet until the end of the year mostly for health reasons but also because I do love my pups and animals in general and me being NOT a contributing factor to animal based food is a total bonus. 

So far I have completely eliminated breakfast, lunch and mid day snacking of any type of animal based products. Dinner is not clean yet but it’s better and my good friend has a diet that he leaned into that worked for dinner. I’ve started doing this same transition and aside from (some) fish and shrimp, I’m well on my way to hitting his dinner diet. 

Here’s my problem, at like 11pm-1am before I’m really alseep for the night I become INCREDIBLY hungry. Like enough to start contributing to my constant thoughts. And for clarity, I’m a male, 5 foot 6, and 150 pounds. I’m not overweight and I don’t have an eating disorder.

Before I started trying to make this change, I was a HEAVY chicken, steak/ground beef, and porkchop eater. And I never really got hungry like THIS late at night but if I felt the hunger bug, I would eat a couple strips of beef jerky and go to bed.

So I’m asking the experts, PLEASE! is it a calorie based deficiency causing this late night hunger or do I need to supplement protein or maybe carbs to prevent this. 

It’s happening just about every night so I know I’m craving something. My weight has stayed consistent for the first 8 weeks so I am questioning calories verse supplements.",1627811570

We're looking for adult meat-eaters interested in reducing their meat consumption to try it out (sorry currently UK only). If this sounds like you (or anybody you know) please do check it out here: [www.optimisediet.org](http://www.optimisediet.org/)

The programme aims to help individuals self-monitor their meat consumption, learn about the health and environmental impacts of their meat intake, set a meat reduction goal and try out various meat reduction strategies. All of this is delivered remotely through our website. The study lasts nine weeks and we think it should take around 2-5 minutes of your time daily during weeks 1-5, and 9.

More information is available on our study website where you can also sign up!

I am pretty in shape and I workout a bunch, mainly running.
I want to switch to mostly, or 100% plant based diet. I am mainly worried about not feeling full or satiated or that I won't be eating enough calories. I don't change what I eat too much daily so I don't care for too much variety.

What would a typical daily meal plan look like? I love most fruits, and for veggies I can do broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, carrots, and I think that's most of what I like. I keep seeing baked potatoes and rice are something to help feel full.
I have been doing OMAD for a few months and i have been at a plateau. 
Any advice for switching? Also, army has me living in hotels so I mainly have a microwave and air fryer to use. I do have a fridge atleast.

Fermented beans have a very interesting taste, with a bit of tanginess and a very...strong...smell. I know there are traditional fermented bean recipes (e.g. nattō), but I think this is slightly different in that the beans are fermented before cooking and they are fermented using wild strains of bacteria (rather than using a known strain), which is apparently what leads to the distinctive smell.

This is my first physical since going plant based two months ago, and all in all, I am far healthier than I was! Lower weight, little to no inflammation (huge improvement!), and all my numbers were in the normal range. Yay! My doctor was very impressed.

However my LDL Cholesterol, for the first time in my life was a bit high. The note claims that LDL should be under 100, and mine was exactly 100. I know I'm doing nearly everything I can just by being WFPB and exercising, but is there anything I can do to bring this down? I don't eat sugar or white flour, and eat exclusively PB with some tofu and gardenburgers my only deviation on occasion. I usually do four hours a week of ashtanga yoga as well, but am currently nursing a strained hamstring so taking a month or so off.

I am mostly worried about this because when I was pregnant with my son I had borderline gestational diabetes, and was told that this can be a warning sign of being predisposed to Type 2 Diabetes in older age. I'm 44 currently. 

Thanks in advance!

Note: I did gain about 20 pounds of pandemic weight, but have lost about half of that, so maybe when I lose the other half the LDL will go down? Here's hoping.",1626886035

PlantBasedDiet,Sweet potato salad! 🍠 🥗 recipe in comments,,1626845837
PlantBasedDiet,How does a man go about starting a plant based diet?,"So basically my entire life I’ve been eating like a carnivore. In my culture, we eat lots of meat. Since I was born my family would eat lots of meat, and I was raised on meat. My dad ate tons of meat and his daddy did before him. We did eats lots of wild meats like moose, rabbit, deer, fish, even beaver and things like that, but I haven’t been able to do this for some time now. I never feel my hunger is satisfied unless I get some meat, and I’ve been having to buy all my meat from grocery stores and can’t afford to ensure I’m getting all my meat from ethical  sources. I feel bad because they treat those animals terribly and their lives are suffering, I don’t want to support that and we can’t be killing them cows and piggies and shit so much, especially if all they know is suffering and torture. Because of this, I want to cut back my meat consumption until I’m a position where I can hunt my own meat again, and also I want to reduce my probably massive risk of heart disease. 

The problem is, I’m not sure how to go about it in a way that sustains my health and physical condition. I’m a strong and thick guy and I want to maintain this, I don’t want to lose all my muscles and weight and I also don’t want to be deficient in any nutrients typically coming from my meat. My sport also requires I remain strong, so how can I switch to a more plant based diet while maintains physical condition/health? Not planning on going vegan but just cutting down on meat consumption and eating mostly plants.",1626836439

PlantBasedDiet,Well-researched books on plant based diets that are a bit “dry”?,"Right now, I’m reading How Not to Die, and I like the approachability of the book and the research behind it, but am finding some interpretations of the data and context around it a bit too editorialized and sensational for my taste, particularly around things like industry funding and the drug industry. While I believe diet is an important part of my personal health and well-being (why else would I be here?), I want to use it in conjunction with - *not* as a replacement for - the minimal medications I’m currently on. I have anxiety, depression, and panic disorder, and I am aware of the side effects of my antidepressant. It’s been life-saving and life changing for me, and even if I would be considered an exception, consuming more media that suggests I could have remedied this with natural methods doesn’t sit well with me. I suffered for so long unnecessarily because of the stigma against medication, and I’d like to avoid more of that messaging, as I do not see the benefits of coming off my antidepressant ever outweighing the significant pain and suffering I know is on the other side without it. It helps me stay stable and off more addictive and dangerous medication, and makes it possible for me to live a normal life.

I’ve noticed this trend among natural and green spaces in general - for example, it is difficult to find zero-waste toothpaste that incorporates fluoride. Yes, I am aware of corporate interests, funding, and lobbying - I don’t need or want reminders to “follow the money” and check my sources, though I do appreciate knowing where study funding came from and digging into study design on my own.

Are there any books on this subject that are a bit less editorialized in their approach to reviewing the studies? I’ll admit that for the most part, How Not to Die seems reasonably researched and well-written, and there are caveats for everything, including my situation. But I think it’s pushing my limits in its approach to portraying modern medicine. I love good criticism and reporting, but I’d like to stay away from sensationalized, conspiracy-theory type language in that type of discussion, as I notice friends of mine in numerous circles rely too heavily on it to prove their point, instead of working with facts.

Any suggestions? I have access to research databases and am happy to read research directly (it’s kind of a hobby of mine, I’m actually in the arts but happen to work at a university that gives me access to these tools), so reading the original papers isn’t an issue if that’s the best source for learning. I was just wondering if there were any books on this topic that avoid that language or insinuation.",1626747606

PlantBasedDiet,Been pretty lazy about my diet for a few months. Want to get back on track and I hope ya'll can help!,"I'm a 21-year-old Indian male with no major health issues but slightly underweight. Made the switch in Oct. 2019. Things took a turn around winter last year. We have some festivals around this time, which means I'm surrounded by A LOT of unhealthy food. Although I was never super strict about what I ate (I was/am 100% plant-based though), my diet gradually started getting worse, i.e. I started eating more and more junk food, and eating a lesser variety of food types. I was also dealing with some other issues (not health-related), which created a significant impact as well.

Last week I made a commitment to get back on track permanently, and I have plenty of doubts I'd like to clear up for myself. I plan to make more posts about specific questions, but for now I'll like to know about reaching daily nutrient targets.

I'd like to (re)start using Cronometer (not obsessively, though) cos it keeps things interesting for me and I believe that ""what gets measured, gets done"". In most cases, at least.

So my question is, **what changes should I make to the ""nutrient targets"" in Cronometer?** For example, I know that calcium requirements are much lower (~700mg) than what's usually recommended (1000-1200 mg/d), especially for people who eat mostly plant food. Are Dr. Greger's recommendations good enough? What about the nutrients for which he doesn't give recommendations?

PlantBasedDiet,Vegans are actually pretty priveledged when you think about it.,"Judgement of meat eaters aside. 

Just imagine how lucky vegans are.

We grew up in a world that specifically raises kids to eat animal products ,  and somehow found out that we don't need to eat them to live a healthy life. 

Not only are we lucky that we stumbled across the info of nutrition and such but we also were smart enough to believe it.

Most adults i know probably don't hold the capacity to accept we can live on only plants and still enjoy food. 

Just imagine being one of the souls that refuses to even try a vegan diet and has to go through all the regular health issues that start to break down health early. Heart disease, balding, vision loss, osteoperosis, cancer, diabetes, etc. 

all of which have ties to high cholesterol, high fat, lifestyles. 

i know just cuz you're vegan doesn't mean you're healthy but i know i do my best to be healthy while respecting animal lives at the same time. I decided to eat healthier and more plant based originally and ended up going vegan because animal products harm the environment and are also linked to some of the most demonic satanic practices found on earth. Religion and judgement aside. Animal agriculture is some of the most disgusting work we do as humans on earth.

During my journey, I’ve learned that a WFPB SOS diet would be beneficial and fit well within my lifestyle. I have been strictly on this for a month. 

I have stopped counting calories to make sure I didn’t have any issues making the change, but I feel like I am overeating. One day I tallied up the weight of the foods I eat and I was shocked that it was 8 lbs of food, mostly fruits and non-starchy vegetables. Probably closer to 9 lbs, just in case in missed logging or my scale was not correct. 

The specific foods were apples, berries, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, zucchini, onion, cauliflower, etc. I tend to eat massive salads of iceberg lettuce and go easy on the peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes. Dressing is apple cider vinegar mixed with stone ground mustard. I did have 1/2 cup rolled oats, 2 bananas, 2 small/medium red potatoes. 

Is this something for which I should be concerned? Should I take a few days and log my calories?

[https://joinzoe.com/post/expert-webinar-calories-do-they-really-count](https://joinzoe.com/post/expert-webinar-calories-do-they-really-count)
&gt;
&gt; Figures on food labels tell us nothing about other important factors, such as the structure of the food (the food matrix), how the food was processed, and any interactions between nutrients.
&gt;
&gt; For example, [grinding or chopping almonds affects their food matrix](https://joinzoe.com/post/are-nuts-bad-for-you-why-the-calorie-counts-for-almonds-dont-add-up) and allows us to absorb more calories from them than from the same amount of whole nuts. Similarly, finely ground oatmeal causes less healthy blood sugar spikes than larger oatmeal pieces.
&gt;
&gt; Calories also don’t tell us anything about the quality of the food we’re eating. A hundred calories of candy is very different in nutritional terms from a hundred calories of nuts or kale.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; “In my opinion, the back of pack labelling or the nutrient composition and the calories, only tells us one piece of a thousand-piece puzzle,” Sarah says.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Food is complicated but humans are complicated too, and many factors affect our response to food, from our genetics and body shape to our microbiome and sleep patterns.
&gt;
&gt; Our PREDICT studies show that [even identical twins can have very different responses to the same foods](https://joinzoe.com/post/nature-medicine-predict-1). And identical twins can [gain different amounts of weight](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199005243222101) in response to overeating by the same amount.

&gt; If you transplant the gut microbiota from an obese mouse 🐁 into a thin mouse 🐁, and keep the diet exactly the same (same food &amp; calories), the thin mouse will become obese. WHAT?!? 😳

&amp;nbsp;

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/)
&gt;
&gt; A link between obesity and the gut microbiota was initially suggested based on studies in germ-free mice. These mice are raised in a sterile environment and have no microorganisms in their gut. Conventionally reared mice have a 40% higher body fat content and 47% higher gonadal fat content than germ-free mice even though they consume less food than their germ-free counterparts. Furthermore, when the distal gut microbiota from the normal mice was transplanted into the gnotobiotic mice, there was a 60% increase in body fat within 2 weeks without any increase in food consumption or obvious differences in energy expenditure suggesting that the gut microbiota affects phenotypic characteristics related to obesity of the host. Mechanistic studies revealed that the transplanted microbiota not only increased caloric release from dietary plant polysaccharides, but also modulated host genes that affect energy deposition in adipocytes including fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf). Fiaf is a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor and its suppression is essential for the microbiota-induced deposition of triglycerides in adipocytes. These findings suggest that the presence of a gut microbial community may affect the amount of energy that is extracted from the diet and thus the adiposity of the host.

&amp;nbsp;

I bet that's gotta settle all kinda arguments (on both sides that is) after all these years.

A calorie is really is JUST a calorie, if and only if we human beings weren't consuming it.

Once we've ingested something, our gut bacteria will determine what's gonna happen next.

Simply put, eat minimally processed foods (i.e. let's just keep it simple and stick with boiling / chopping / cutting / dicing / steaming etc. in order to avoid unnecessary or excessive changes that are applied to the food matrix) while feeding our friendly gut bacteria with plenty of fiber.

I’m absolutely clueless about Plant Based Diet never thought that it has a much better good as opposed to meat based diet. 

I’m gonna be honest here. I just watched “The Game Changers” on Netflix and it blew up my mind, I was like, How could I have not known about it ? 

Anyway, I’ll still do a research but I think my mind is pretty much made up. At some point in the near future I’ll do a Plant Based Diet. The thing is I don’t know where and how to start such as : the recipes , what I need to buy, what plant, what vegetables to buy and so on. So , please just tell me everything you know.

PlantBasedDiet,New Kebab recipe using Impossible meat (it's a work in progress lol),"Ingredients:
1 pound impossible meat (it comes in the square packet)

half an onion minced (better in a food processor so you can squeeze out the water)

1 tablespoon garlic (about 4 to 5 cloves) minced

1 jalapeño pepper chopped up (this adds the heat so if you can't handle it...leave it out lol)

red chili - half teaspoon

black pepper - 1/4 teaspoon 

pipli (long pepper) - if you don't have this it's ok. if you do, grind a 1 inch piece and just put ONE pinch into the meat mixture

1 teaspoon powder coriander 

1 teaspoon powder cumin 

1/4 teaspoon garam masala

Directions:
wash your hands and MIX everything by hand in a big bowl for at least 1 minute

now get a pan and add 1/4 cup oil (i used canola but vegetable or some other neutral oil is fine)

put it on medium heat 

grab a tiny ball and roll them into small cylinder shapes in your hands 

place as many as you can in the pan without touching 

check every 5 minutes to make sure they are getting brown on the bottom

when they get brown on the bottom, flip them

when both sides are brown place them on a plate with paper towels

Biggest confusion comes from the no oils approach and/or the no juices.

And even based on the ""whole food"" - no ""hyperprocessed foods""...this all seems very subjective and lacking in any measurable qualifications.

I originally looked at a post where people were questioning oils/mayo used in a post and if the ""followed the rules"" but the rabbit hole only gets deeper when I traced how olives are processed...OYVEY!

see:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oStoeHntfG8 

Is there any simplicity someone can share here when the rules seem to get in the way?...does the amounts, percentages etc of an ingredient allow their use? ...as in olive oil, lemon juice, etc.?

PlantBasedDiet,"Ultra-processed foods are associated with depression [Front. Nutr., 15 December 2020]","This speaks to the ""whole food"" aspect of this group.

&gt; UPFs are essentially industrial formulations mostly or entirely made from industrial ingredients, with little or no whole foods. They often contain substances not used in home cooking, especially the additives for sensory properties of food ([3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B3)). Typical UPFs include carbonated beverages, bagged snacks, mass-produced packaged bread and buns, and ice cream.    
&gt;  
&gt; UPF producers prioritize taste, cost, storage, and stability during transport, whereas neglecting nutritional quality ([6](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B6)). UPFs are common in the western dietary pattern and generally rich in total fat, saturated fat, added sugar, and salt, whereas poor in fiber and vitamin density ([7](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B7), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B8)), which is detrimental to mental health ([9](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B9), [10](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B10)).   
&gt;  
&gt;Discussion  
&gt;  
&gt;In this study, we found UPF consumption was positively associated with depressive symptoms in US adults. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and chronic disease, participants whose UPF contributed more than 73% of total energy intake had a 35% higher risk of depressive symptoms compared with whose UPF contributed &lt;34% of total energy intake.

PlantBasedDiet,Scientific Meal Planner Summer Update,"Hello plant based community!

I’m Dan, developer of [The Scientific Meal Planner](https://scientificmealplanner.com/), and I’ve just launched a major update!

If you haven’t heard about it yet, this is a tool which utilizes the latest nutrition science to generate extremely healthy meal plans. You’re probably aware that science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality. 

It generates meal plans that attempt to satisfy [nutritionfacts.org’s Daily Dozen foods](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) you should incorporate into your diet daily. Every day in the meal plan satisfies a minimum of 75% of the Daily Dozen servings, something that is really difficult to plan out yourself manually.   
It also has a lot of options you can layer on top. For example, you can generate a meal plan where:

* Every day satisfies at least 75% of the Daily Dozen
* Every day has 1700-2000 calories
* All recipes take 30 minutes or less
* It doesn’t contain foods you don’t like or are allergic to 

The big addition in this update is [The Daily Dozen Recipe Browser](https://scientificmealplanner.com/recipes/browse). This lets you browse all recipes in the site, filtering by which daily dozen groups they contain, and other filters that let you find something that matches your tastes. The idea being you can use this whenever you’re just looking for a one-off recipe, and not an entire meal plan. It’s freely accessible, no log in or payment required, but premium users get additional filters.  
The other big change is that I made the tough call to remove the totally free version of the meal planner. If you’ve been following the project, you’d know that I’ve been struggling with balancing my desire for this to help people eat healthy and the financial realities of spending my time working on this. Originally the site was 100% free, to then adding a premium option, to now the latest evolution which is getting rid of the free version.

I still want it to be as accessible as possible, so I’ve introduced a cheaper, yearly plan that comes out to $4.99/mo. It has a 14 day free trial now too. I wrote a blog post about my reasoning for this change [here](https://scientificmealplanner.com/blog/the-road-to-sustainability).   
I think this change will help get the project to a more sustainable place where I can continue development indefinitely. My vision for The Scientific Meal Planner is to continuously improve it as new science becomes available, honing the meal planning algorithm to produce the best evidence based meal plans for health and longevity. [Here’s what I’m currently working on](https://trello.com/b/UQkPED8a/the-scientific-meal-planner).

I hope you’ll consider supporting the project! Or if you just want to find some healthy recipes, check out the [Daily Dozen Recipe Browser for free](https://scientificmealplanner.com/recipes/browse), forever.

That makes sense because they took their portion of the beans and added a bunch of other stuff that would heavily mask the flavor.

I should've trusted the gut feeling I had and stopped eating them after the first bite but I regrettably finished the bowl. About three days later, I opened the jar they were stored in and there was a horrid odor in them, very pungent and a bit moldy even though I didn't see any mold. They had probably been in an early-ish stage of rot when I cooked and ate them.

Anyway, the night of eating them, I let off the damn worst fart I've ever produced in my life. The amount of gas wasn't unusual or excessive. I didn't have any other issues, like cramping or diarrhea. It was just a god awful fart, heavy *and* lingering. It was the first of many over the next two weeks until I caught on.

That's pretty much what has happened every time I eat legumes. I've eaten pinto beans my whole life and in the past few years greatly increased black bean, chickpea, kidney bean, and lentil consumption. I've eaten all of those without issue for years now, even the day before the spoiled pinto beans. They have never done anything remotely close to this to me. Doesn't matter if they're canned, soaked before cooking, cooked extra long, whatever, they cause this problem now. The only exceptions seem to be peanuts and tofu.

I avoid split green peas and navy beans because they will give me bad gas and I avoid whole wheat for the same reason; the effects of those foods are nothing, and I mean nothing close to this. Nothing else in my diet appears to be an issue. Brassica vegetables, peppers, allium, corn, potatoes, oats, quinoa, mushrooms, fruit, nuts, and seeds, pretty much everything else... I can still eat without issue.

I cut legumes out entirely for a few weeks and now have them every once in a while to see if the issue has resolved itself. It hasn't. I love legumes, so even though there are tons of other plants to fill their space nutrition-wise, I will greatly miss the flavor and comfort they (used to) bring me if I can't have them again.

I'm willing to do a stool test if necessary but all of those things seem to be fairly pricey and I'd like to maybe try some other suggestions, if any, before resorting to that.

Thanks in advance.",1625804271

The main idea is:
""We suggest the novel hypothesis that EPA and DHA may compete against each other through overlapping mechanisms. First, EPA and DHA may compete for residency in membrane phospholipids and thereby differentially displace n-6 PUFAs, which are highly prevalent in the Western diet. This would influence biosynthesis of downstream metabolites of inflammation initiation and resolution. Second, EPA and DHA exert different effects on plasma membrane biophysical structure, creating an additional layer of competition between the fatty acids in controlling signaling. Third, DHA regulates membrane EPA levels by lowering its rate of conversion to EPA’s elongation product n-3 docosapentaenoic acid.""

Then the next day I'd be fine. The joint paint would be entirely random too. It'd be in my left ankle one day then my right wrist the next.

I've always had an issue with chickpeas. They didn't sit right with me. The only time I ever felt great was when I ate nothing but potatoes and greek yogurt for two weeks, the strictest elimination diet I've ever tried.

I am interested in nutrition and I am trying to move to a plant based diet. I still eat some animal products (mostly yogurt and sometimes meat when I go out) but when I cook I mostly eat legumes, rice, veggies, oat and fruit. 

I have started to do more of this and eat less meat around two weeks ago and my sleep became much worse. I used to sleep around 7 hours per night whereas now I sleep a maximum of 5 hours. I often feel groggy when I wake up and in general during the day I feel ""less smart"" and slower mentally.  


I think my calories are not too low. I have reviewed my diet on cronometer and I am at around 2000 calories per day. I was also cutting before so I don't think this is too low for me.  


I am not having the best period for other reasons so I may have poor sleep just because I am a bit depressed etc.  


Are there other people who noticed a similar pattern of poor sleep after transitioning to a plant based diet? I feel that there may be two reasons for this:  
1)lower energy because animal products have more calories on average  
2)I miss some micronutrient from animal products

PlantBasedDiet,“Cheating” is just not worth it,"Since the pandemic started 1.5 years ago I’ve been stuck in a small village in a country where there are absolutely no processed vegan foods available, so eating WFPB has been extremely easy (and has made me feel amazing). However, because I was stuck somewhere, I was daydreaming for WELL over a year about all the crazy delicious vegan junk food I would let myself splurge on when I’d be able to travel to a place with these kinds of foods. 

Well, I’ve finally just arrived in America, and I just spent an obscene amount of money at a vegan cafe: Cesar salad with bacon, a fried chicken parmesan sub with mozzarella, and a free side of Mac and cheese (obligatory: yes all vegan). I had about one bite of each before a very powerful wave of nausea came over me and I had to stop. I was actually shocked, because I used to be able to eat these kinds of foods incredibly easily. But now I barely managed a few bites of something I’d be dreaming about for ages; and it was a complete waste of money which bums me out. I’m bleak. 

Now all I can think about is how amazing I’d feel if I’d just had some beans and vegetables. And how much ******* money I’d have saved, too. 

It really is true: the longer you are on this lifestyle, the nastier processed junk becomes. It’s a bummer that I obviously still crave it, but the physical feeling after eating it is horrible. I drove home wondering if I was going to puke in the car. 

Here’s to broccoli from here on out. And hoping these cravings someday go away.",1625613484

PlantBasedDiet,Folic Acid Overdose,"So I know that Folic acid is the synthetic form of Folate. It's not possible to overdose on natural Folate, but it is possible to overdose on synthetic Folic Acid.

My question is: If I were to take a vegan supplement that contained synthetic Folic Acid, would I be in danger of overdosing on Folic Acid since I already exceed the UL with my natural Folate intake? Would me taking Folic Acid whilst consuming large amounts of Folate cause any problems or does the body process these two chemicals differently?

The reason I'm asking is because I'm a college student so I need to find cheap and reliable ways to get Iodine (I don't want to use seaweed or iodised salt) and B12 into my diet. I'm considering using the Vegan Society's VEG 1 supplement because it comes in large bottles and is very cheap so a single bottle will last me a long time. The problem is, VEG1 contains 200 mcg of Folic Acid, meaning that if I took it daily I would be getting over 1200 mcg of Folate/Folic Acid from my diet and the supplement.

PlantBasedDiet,Confusion about grains,"So I made a post about white vs brown rice and I now understand that to be a whole grain it must include the bran, so white rice is not a whole grain anymore. 

But after looking into grains more and thinking about how we actually obtain the grain from the grass I now realise that whole grains are also stripped of their hull, and this makes me think what is healthy a husked grain a whole grain or a white grain and does it matter also. 

So basically all grains are slightly processed as the husk is removed and you might think well the husk is inedible but it’s not entirely true as I saw that samurai used to actually eat husked rice and this got me thinking maybe we should be too and for all other grains. 

Another point is that removing the husk is not that simple and without machinery or hand tools which would take a long time for modern amounts of grain to feed people it’s not very easy to do so. So likely “back in the day” people would’ve eaten husked grains a lot more or they would’ve milled them also. 

After learning this I’m just confused on what is healthy, does it matter whether it’s husked or whole or white, or does it only matter if it’s plant derived and no need for entirely wfpb. I know fibre is healthy and other things so I know eating mostly whole foods is healthy, but my confusion is to be 100% as healthy as possible from diet should we be eating 100% whole foods like husked grains or does that not matter. 

Grains are a major part of my diet so I would like to know more about them and what’s the best decision to make. Thanks in advance.",1625266905

Do you think a grain requires it’s outer shell (I don’t know the specific term for it) to be healthy for you? Do you consider white rice wfpb or just plant based?",1625251266

PlantBasedDiet,Is this mega smoothie ok if I'm trying to bulk?,"I've been having a big smoothie and just wondering if I'm having way too much sugar, or if it's ok because it's mostly berries and bananas. I thought I had read that orange juice (OJ) with pulp is WFPB, and not nearly as bad for insulin as OJ without pulp. However, after researching, I can't find a source to back this up.

The smoothie is as follows:

5-6 bananas
2 cups frozen blueberries
2 cups frozen strawberries
2 cups OJ with pulp
1-2 cups kale, finely chopped

I like this smoothie because I get my frozen fruit in bulk from a local grocer, and I can almost always get reduced price ripe bananas which are perfect for smoothie making.


Is anything bad happening if I have this whole smoothie in less than an hour (aside from me being very full, which I usually am haha). Would it be ok if I drank this big smoothie, but sipped it slowly over the whole day? [(See: Sip Smoothies Slowly on Nutritionfacts.org)](https://nutritionfacts.org/2017/11/23/sip-smoothies-slowly/)

I work in landscaping/construction.

According to my research, that’s a form of heat stroke and it’s bad for my health. Also the daily headaches obviously suck. 

I tried making a homemade electrolyte drink (iced tea with lemon juice and salt in it) but it was gross, and it doesn’t include any magnesium, calcium or potassium, which are some of the other minerals lost through sweat. Anyone got some electrolyte drink recipes? How do you include magnesium, potassium, and calcium? Or am I better off using a commercial powder even tho it‘s not WFPB?  

I know that I can just eat foods that are high in those minerals and drink water, but that hasn’t been working for me.

PlantBasedDiet,Need help. Parents won't buy Vitamin B-12 supplement when I told them I'll take it weekly.,"TLDR: Unfournately, I still rely on parents for money, so I asked mother to buy V-B12 supplement. Refused when I said I'll take it weekly. 

Unfortunately, I still live with my parents (18M, just graduated) and do not have a job (still looking), so I am reliant on my parents for financial support. I don't like them (or my family), but I don't have a choice.

So I asked my mother to buy a Vitamin B-12 supplement for me. 

[It was this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C43H9KU/). It has 100 tablets that each contain 5000 mcg. 

I thought it would be the best one, since 

* it costs around $9 and lasts around 2 years.
* I would take one tablet at the beginning of each week (it's recommended for vegans to take a weekly supplement of 2500 mcg; you can't overdose on vitamin B-12), so it's more ""low-maintenance"" (I'll just need to buy a new one every 2 years).  
* it seems to be free of any animal products

I looked for others that offered 2500 mcg tablets, but they had lower ""weeks it will last"" to ""cost"" ratios. 

My mother, on the other hand, refused to buy it and told me that taking a supplement weekly was ""too dangerous,"" and that I should take one daily instead (I assume because she is unfamiliar with someone taking weekly supplements).

I explained to my mother that, despite what the bottle indicates, I could take one weekly, that I couldn't overdose on it (better safe than sorry if I already have B-12 deficiency), and that a weekly approach wouldn't be any more harmful than a daily one. It was simply a matter of personal preference. 

I preferred a weekly approach because it was more low-maintenance (meaning I take a pill each Monday and forget about it for the rest of the week), but my older sister (who misunderstood what the fuck I said) said that my health was not ""low-maintenance."" with the air that I wasn't taking my health seriously. 

My mother also doubted my claim that a daily 250 mcg supplement would be necessary (I said 250 mcg due to the 1.5 +1% rule) because she found recommended daily dose is 2.4 mcg (despite the fact that no 2.4 mcg supplements fucking exist). I tried to explain that your body only absorbs what it needs.

But then she went on to say that because I ""dragged myself into this"" (despite the fact that I was vegan before I told her), I should take my health seriously (despite the fact that I done my research and am more knowledgeable about this than she is) and that I shouldn't take any shortcuts (despite the fact that taking the easier path and compromising my health isn't mutually exclusive). Needless to say, it was pretty frustrating.

Even in the middle of the convo, my mother asked me to eat animal products ""occasionally"" because it wouldn't hurt my body. Despite the fact that I told her I don't eat animal products for ETHICAL reasons, not HEALTH ones. Not only my mother, but even my father has been telling me to ""change my mind"" and keeps saying  shit like ""until I change my mind."" I knew they wouldn't understand, and I was right.",1624768023

PlantBasedDiet,Trying To Get Back On Track,"Hello all,

I have been vegan for almost a year now, and I have loved every minute of it. My life has improved in a myriad of ways, and I was able to lose ~100 lbs from my previously obese state. A WFPB diet played a significant role in helping me to cut the weight and alleviate other health issues, and I was largely committed to the cause for quite a good while.

However, over the past month or so, I have unfortunately diverged from my dedication to WFPB and have fallen into the trap of divulging on more processed vegan foods. I started a new job that demanded much more on-site time, and I began to opt for convenience over quality cooked meals. This has led me to rapidly lose some of the health gains I had previously made after months of dedicated WFPB eating.

I have done all the research and I know how bad these foods are health-wise, but I am currently struggling with trying to will myself back onto a fully WFPB diet. I have tried to cut it out several times, but thus far I have only had short-term success before once again falling off track and gorging on non-WFPB foods. I am trying quite hard, but there seems to be a psychological tether that is making it quite difficult to regain my control.

Has anyone had any experiences like this and been able to recover? If so, what was your process like and what advice can you offer?

Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.",1624487984

PlantBasedDiet,Has anyone seen/read 'The Bad Food Bible' by Dr. Aaron Carroll?,"I haven't read it, frankly don't plan to as it appears to either fly in the face of rather hard evidence, or is what I can only assume to be a poor take on the data. What do I know though, I'm not a doctor.

According to the audible page, Dr. Carroll claims in this book that you can:

* 'Eat red meat several times a week: Thew health effects are negligible for most people, and actually positive if you're 65 or older' (uh, sure)
* 'Have a drink or two a day: As long as it's in moderation, it will protect you against cardiovascular disease without much risk.' (what)
* 'Eat more salt: If your blood pressure is normal, you should be more worried about getting too little sodium than having too much.' (*what*)

I cannot rightly understand how you can come away with those conclusions. Am I just late to the party and everyone here is already aware of Dr. Carroll and how bad his advice appears to be? Has anyone actually read it? Refuted it? I certainly won't be spending money on it so please if you have tell me what you thought.

Later on the article does suggest that the ""highly processed"" *could* be due to heating or cooking destroying the DNA -- but still, seems better to eat food you can positively identify :-)",1624476145

PlantBasedDiet,Has anyone noticed mental or emotional changes after going plant based?,[removed],1624237165
PlantBasedDiet,This diet changed my life .. and could have saved my father,"I... lost my father to cancer of the pancreas. It came in a wave of symptoms , and the diagnosis was given as a death sentence. I had been having a terrible health experience when I was really young. My disability was nonstop given as the reason, so I never questioned it. I got so sick of it at 13 I gave up listening to them and began learning on my own. And there it was: every symptom had an association of some kind to my diet. And, given that a grandparent of my fathers also died of cancer, that terrified me. 

I stripped all the animal foods right away. I was “over reacting”, “crazy”, “hurting X persons feelings” by rejecting their food. It was all thrown at me. 

I had rashes that filled my body and sometimes ended up on my face. The doctors strongest treatment did nothing. “Maybe we need to give you meds. It’s risky tho, it reduces your immune system. So really consider if you can’t live with this.” (Me: maybe this is diet related doc? Doc: LOL no. It has nothing to do with diet, it’s genetic). So destroying my immune system is not extreme, but changing my diet is? Ookay.

Rashes were the first thing that went away. Literally vanished in a few months. People around me excused that away. “No. It wasn’t the diet. You stopped scratching like we all told you. “ or... ya know... inflammation went down, it no longer was itchy, and the inflammation being down cured it.

Then, my pain reduced. I began walking more as a result of that pain reduction. Again, hand waved it away while still saying I was being rude and moronic for not eating animals. “You are moving more and that reduced your pain. If you just listened when I told you to do morning walks you could be eating the same thing. This is the placebo effect.”

My adhd symptoms really improved when my research into plant based eating lead me to the Methyl B12 and Folate forms being shown to help symptoms. I have already been eating those forms in greens, so I couldn’t figure out what was going on . Why was I getting a benefit? Once I began supplanting and maxing our that benefit, I had way more energy. Everyone noticed. I was even running. I threw my walking aid away (cane I use to use). 

Would this transformation be hand waved away? God dam right it did. And the hostility towards me just changing my diet also spiked. now I was attacking them apparently. “Tell me right now why you are accusing me of eating an unhealthy diet.” “I didn’t say anything, I’m not doing this, drop it”. “No. I work hard to inspect where my food comes from and by rejecting basic science with removing protein you are going to get sick. I’m trying to help you but there is only so much I can do before you fall off the deep end. And by eating that nonsense (oatmeal and blueberries while everyone else ate pasta with meat sauce) it’s looking like you’ll get diabetes soon.

This caused massive fights after 3 years of being becoming active, losing 20 lbs without trying (they refused to believe I wasn’t calorie counting and non stop asked me for my deficit to make sure I was being “healthy” about this.)

Now, this was all abusive extended family I use to interact with. My father was the opposite. Loving parent. Loving guy. “Hey, if you are learning more about eating healthy I’m on board with your choice”. He even defended me and halted insults and freak outs directed at me. Numerous times he would see a relative beginning to yell when I would only eat the meal parts that were not animal based. “Does he tell YOU what to eat Steve? Maybe I should start pointing out that cookies you eat are unhealthy. Lotta sugar there buddy your gonna get fat.  Don’t get mad I’m being helpful! Stop attacking my son for his choices or I’ll do it to you”.

Unfortunately... he never accepted the science. He was in a chronic state of pain on pain meds that didn’t work.the healthier I got, the weaker and sicker he got. I kindly and non - judgement way tried to show him the control trials... but it was clear his food addiction won .

He hit 50, like his father who ate the same, and died sooner than he should have. He began losing weight too fast... and they found tumors on his pancreas. He chose to change his diet ... but his body no longer could handle the fiber .

I couldn’t hold it together watching him cry trying to eat without pain. “I screwed up. And now it hurts so much I can’t even try berries and other healthy foods. I’m sorry (me), my choices may have cost you your only parent.”

I was with him when he passed . Sadness. Anxiety. Fear. He couldn’t even eat the foods he loved anymore.

Dad. I miss you so much. You did nothing wrong , you were never taught this information. I should have tried harder to make it easy to understand . 

I love you. I miss you. You didn’t abuse me like everyone else. Today is a black soul day without you. I just... you were my best friend. And all I want to hear is that despite my mistakes taking care of you , that you thought I did a good job.

I’d never taken care of someone before, and while balancing school, it was overwhelming.

Please guys: don’t make choices that increase your risk for this outcome. It destroys your sons.",1624227976

PlantBasedDiet,A Plea About Losing One's Father In The Future,"For context, Dr Neal Barnard's father passed away in 2012. But for all intents and purposes, his father had died years earlier as he states so himself in his [TED Talk](https://youtu.be/v_ONFix_e4k). Towards the end, he says:  


&gt;What I would like to do is to go back in time, and I want to sit down with my dad, and I want to say, ""Dad, I found out something really important. We can change our diet, we don't really need that cheese and that bacon. There's plenty of healthy things that we can eat. Let's bring in the colorful vegetables and fruits, let's make them part of our everyday fair. Let's lace up our sneakers, let's exercise together."" It's too late for him. But it's not too late for you.

This resonated with me a lot because I feel like I am at the point where it's still not too late for my own dad, even though he struggles with asthma, arthritis &amp; possibly is diabetic. Yet, I feel powerless in trying to nudge him towards a WFPB Diet, even by an inch. I tried my best, but he found healthy alternatives to the food he was eating which I served him to be entirely dubious and basically inedible. It doesn't seem likely he will change his eating habits, at least not anytime soon.  


I feel like in the future... when my dad is dead early and/or spends his last moments on Earth being in a state you could barely call ""living,"" I will think back to this moment... wishing I had a time machine. Maybe I should have tried more. Maybe I should have had more patience. Maybe I didn't push him hard enough. Maybe I should have been smarter in my approach. I was successful in changing my mother and brother, but I feel like I will lose my father in the future. Dying of a cause easily preventable. And spending his last years on this planet not in good health. I hope that doesn't end up true. And I wish everyone luck with convincing your own loved ones if you are in a similar situation.

I strongly believe in the Whole Foods Plant Based diet but the rest of my family doesn’t like many healthy foods besides fruit. Which also makes it hard for me to eat healthy. We mostly just eat the vegan substitute products for everything. Our typical day looks like this:

 - Breakfast: Yoplait vegan yogurt (no nutrition)
- Lunch: Morningstar farms vegan corn dogs (barely any nutrition)
- Dinner: Annie’s vegan mac n cheese, a piece of bread, and a small side of steamed veggies (barely any nutrition) 
- Dessert: Packaged vegan pudding (no nutrition) 

I do not like these “foods” much and find them downright sickening but it’s all we buy. I know that with time, this diet will take a toll on everyone. My parents are aware of the befits that a whole food plant based diet has but they never want to eat real food or make the recipes. They are very picky eaters.

Because it’s rare that we have more than 2 servings of fruit or veggies in the fridge at one time and I am constantly starving and exhausted from eating only fillers every meal.

I love it because the smoothies keep me full and energized for much longer and it goes a long way to hitting my [Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/) for beans.

Today my dad mentioned that he heard lima beans contained cyanide. I dismissed it at first as probably only negligible trace amounts.

It's been tough for me to find info on this, but from what I've read so far it's no longer clear to me that it's negligible. Most sites recommend cooking lima beans before eating, at least in part to neutralize the cyanide-producing compound.

So I have 3 questions:

1. Do raw lima beans contain enough cyanide that a 1/2 cup a day is something worth trying to avoid?
2. Are frozen lima beans raw, blanched, or cooked long enough to address the cyanide concern? Should I microwave them for a few minutes before putting them in the smoothie?
3. What's the best or your go-to bean for smoothies? Looking for ones that are easy and don't take over the taste of the smoothie.

I eat a plant based diet, with the sole exception of wild game that I hunt. I’ve kept wild game in my diet (even reintroduced it) after going plant based, and I’ve found that personally I feel best eating this way.

My girlfriend and I have been working towards opening a plant based restaurant or food cart.

She is strict vegetarian/generally vegan and does not eat any wild game, which I am completely impartial to. 
 
So here is the dilemma that I have.  I do not want to be disingenuous or have some type of scandal evolve from my choice to both hunt and also push a plant based diet. If you found out that the owner of a plant based shop hunted, would you boycott or protest the shop? I have considered putting it in my bio once/if we get a website up, but it’s a personal choice that I’m making and I feel it is separate from this professional endeavor.
Just looking for some advice on how to approach this (not to be shamed for a personal choice). Thank you!",1623965240

PlantBasedDiet,Getting Started: What advice helped you the most?,"Hello! So I am starting the transition to eating more of a plant based diet. I received the advice that it would be best to slowly work meats out of my system and I've heard this is a common practice. I am starting to feel a difference and am glad that I am taking it slow. I feel my body is adjusting better than the times I have tried before when I just tried to cut everything out that day. I got that advice from a podcast I listen to (Be Sexy Eat Plants [https://apple.co/3gERJif](https://apple.co/3gERJif)) and was wondering what other tips you would all recommend as I start?

&amp;#x200B;

They also suggested not being afraid of variety and having the confidence to throw recipes together and to not be afraid of a bad recipe, drinking extra water and being prepared to eat more. 

&amp;#x200B;

PlantBasedDiet,My why: Alzheimer's Prevention.,"I've recently found out that Alzheimer's is EXTREMELY strong on my mother's side of the family.  It's present on my father's side as well, but my mother's side is what concerns me.  Most of those that died passed away from Alzheimer's.  

My mother started a plant based diet a year and a half ago, and it was only last weekend that she shared why she's doing it, and it's really stuck pretty hard in my brain since then.  No meat, no dairy or animal byproducts has been scientifically proven to drastically reduce the risk/prolong the onset/can even prevent Alzheimer's.  I did a fair amount of research on studies done and those that ate fruits, vegetables, grains and fish were astoundingly less at risk than those that follow a traditional American diet.  Like... 50% or more less likely.  My mother's words ""I want to be 90 with my mind in tact"" is ringing through my mind the last 5 days.  I am pregnant with my first, and i want to be around for my grandkids and be able to babysit without someone feeling like they need to supervise me.

Two days ago, i decided to soft start with this lifestyle change.  It's something that i'm taking far more seriously as the days are progressing.  There are many resources for recipies, Google, TikTok, Instagram, i ordered a cookbook and a Plant Based guide.  I love to cook, and 99% of the time i don't use recipes, i just wing it.  I would consider myself a good cook, but this is throwing me   
 for a loop as almost every meal i cooked used some kind of meat and/or daily.  I wanted to ask this community a few questions:

\-What were some things you wish someone had told you when starting this lifestyle change?

\-Best ways of incorporating protein?

\-Do you know of any guides or websites that may be helpful for someone starting off?

\-Best restaurants for quick plant based options?

\-What are products you thought were plant based that turned out not to be?

PlantBasedDiet,Should I go on statins at 25?,"Hello guys, so I'd like to present you my case. I am 25 year old male who is weight training for years now (3x a week) and does no cardio. I can bench 100kg for reps, deadlift 180kg for reps and squat 127.5 kg for reps. My diet is filled with 'good' and 'bad'. I primarily eat lean meat and veggies for lunch, for breakfast I eat some sort of greek yogurt and dinner is a bit murky, sometimes it's junk, other times it's something like tuna and salad (1 a week to prevent mercury poisoning).

I am 177cm and weigh 91kg. 

My blood results are as follows:
Total Cholesterol - 6.46 mmol/L (3.9 - 5.2)
LDL - 4.28 mmol/L ( it should be less than 3.30 optimally)
HDL - 1.53 mmol/L (it should be more than 1.55 optimally)

Honestly I've tried reading about if statins but there's just so much info that I don't know if they are a good trade off for side effects they give in comparison to benefit. I don't know if my levels can be controlled with diet and exercise, I can try, but even when I did cardio a few years ago and was leaner my cholesterol was still not really good. My diet was still not perfect tho. Only once my results showed good measurements.

With all this in mind, I don't know if I should take statins if doc recommends them. They have benefits and sides, but those benefits need to outweigh the sides but also those benefits need to be there in the first place. Meaning if you don't need to lower cholesterol due to ridiculous small reference values why would you? I am not well versed in science, I am just thinking out loud.

I know that for example my psychiatrist gave me SSRI and 'benefits' weren't worth the sides. There were actually no benefits, I was still depressed but I also got sides that remained despite me quitting meds. I don't want that this time.

What would you say, should I go for statins? Can diet regulate this, and if so which diet is a good choice?",1623847894

PlantBasedDiet,Can people be fat and healthy? How is health actually lost?,"So I was talking to a few friends the other day. They're all heavy meat eaters (the kind of people that also cook with lard, have eggs for breakfast almost daily, etc.), drink moderately (used to be heavy drinkers), smoke occasionally but have smoked for prolonged periods of time, rarely exercise -- you name it. It's by far one of the unhealthiest group of people that I know (we're all in our mid-30s). They're all clinically obese (250lbs at least). One of them even just had a bariatric surgery. ""We might be fat, but we're healthy fat"" is something that they would totally say. You get the idea.

However, to my surprise, they (4) mentioned that, according to their latest test results, they're all either very healthy or perfectly healthy (one of them mentioned that his uric acid level is just 1 point above normal).

Now, obviously they could all be lying, but I doubt it. Assuming that they're not, my question is: how is this even possible? Are some people better suited to process meat without in a less harmful way? Or do general health checkups don't paint the full picture (they measured at least cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and uric acid)? Is health lost 'gradually, then suddenly'? Or is it that they're still relatively young and can get away with it? Are we as a community just overly-conscious about our health? Or is there something that I'm missing? 

To be honest, I'm choosing this lifestyle because I care about my health and I'm convinced that this is the healthiest way to live long-term. I just wonder sometimes why some people can apparently just get away with it.",1623809971

However, now that the pandemic is over I now have new challenges, social events are frequent.  I have many events lined up in the next few weeks (too many for my liking).  I have strayed due to social situations and am not willing to do that anymore despite my packed schedule.  How do you say no to food with oil (which it is literally in everything).  I am thinking of saying something like ""i follow a strict plant based no oil diet for health reasons"".  I feel like this would be a good quick explanation that would be understandable and relieve me of anxiety.  Telling people oil is bad for you is just not something my anxiety can handle since there is so much controversy surrounding this topic.

We are interested in data and research, so we did some math on how much land it *really* will take to feed the whole continent in the next 100 years. We are inspired by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 report showing that land is the most critical resource on the planet right now and that a global shift to plant-based habits is the most impactful shift we can make to stop climate change.

It’s easy to see how much better a plant-based diet is for the land and the planet. Vegan AF also feels that these numbers clearly show that it will be impossible to continue moving down the path towards mass adoption of the western diet. We have to come back to our roots.

So, any ideas on a WFPB substitute for cream cheese? I have tried hummus and it is not awful, but also  not really the same as cream cheese. Ditto for mashed avocado. Maybe some plain hummus with some sort of additive that might make it more cream cheese-like?

Soy sauce. I checked at the store today, and normal soy sauce has 960mg of sodium per tbsp. Low sodium Tamari had 790mg, and low sodium Kikoman’s had 590mg (but Kikoman’s wouldn’t be my first choice for soy sauce). Any recommendations for my soy sauce or is there something else I could use (maybe a vinegar concoction?). 

Veggie broth. I normally use Better than Bullion, which has oil and salt in small amounts. I figure it’s fine to use, but wanted to get y’all’s opinion. 

Hummus, I saw a video where Rip said to get “no oil added hummus”, I’m guessing this is commercially available, but I’m not sure. I could, of course make my own, but my recipe uses Tahini, which seems fine, but it is of course not without oil.

PlantBasedDiet,Side effects as I transition to WFPB?,"I have started a WFPB diet about 2 weeks ago because I have high cholesterol.  I'm having a few unexpected and tbh disappointing side effects.  **Anyone experience these?**

\- **Weight gain.**  I'm counting calories to ensure I'm getting the same amount as before switching, but I still find myself struggling to stay at the same weight.

\- **Light headedness.**  I'm exhausted to the point of being light headed.  I would have guessed it was a calorie intake issue, but since I'm also eating enough to gain weight, I'm not sure this is the issue.

\- **Lack of satiety.**  I think I'm full, but I don't feel satisfied - like something is missing - and I cannot figure out what it is my body is looking for (except for meat and cheese).

I'd love to hear your personal experiences with these issues and how you were able to work through them.

PlantBasedDiet,I'm confused about the essentialness of omega-3 fats.,"Hello.

I've become vegan for ethical reasons, and I hear the nutrients that should be given greater attention are Vitamin B-12, Vitamin D and omega-3 fats (which you can find outside of supplements). But I'm unsure of the essentiality of the last one.

Before I considered animal ethics, I consumed dead fish flesh (DFF), which is considered one of the main sources in a carnist diet. But never in a consistent manner (I don't even remember eating it at all as a young child). Just from time to time. But as far as I'm concerned, I have not experienced any health complications. In fact, my brother (22, not on a vegan diet) hates DFF and has been fine.

So...what should I make of this? I really don't wanna promote any health pseudoscience, but I'm kind of in a confused place right now.",1623383522

I’ve recently gone plant based for weight loss, and it’s been working like gangbusters. The only problem I’ve had has been just really bad thirst. I mean, wake up at 5 am, drink almost a quart of water and still thirsty.

I got blood work done and turns out I have low sodium levels now. This could be related. Glucose was fine, mostly; not prediabetic yet. Plant based diets are usually very low in sodium—is there anything I can do without adding table  salt to my diet? I’m mostly eating beans in chilies and soups and some veggies.

PlantBasedDiet,How do you not offend friends/family?,"I love being on a plant based diet. Not only have my taste buds changed that fruit tastes like candy, but: my pain has reduced; my cardio system is so good that no matter how much normal day to day movement I perform I feel not out of breath; I am walking EVERY MORNING and i feel even BETTER every day I do it; I recover from exercise so well that I dont get DOMS, nor does exercising the day before ever prevent me form doing it again the next day.  


I am also really low income, and my food budget has dropped to about 30-40 dollars every shopping trip (I go shopping maybe 2 times a month).   


However...the second my family and certain friends find out...it always follows a repeat pattern (unless they are in the minority of heavy good person, and accepting me for who I am);  


1. They find out I am eating plant based and dont consume animal products. They ask me why. I tell them ""I am not a vegan. I just love the taste. I feel more energized and less depressed. I am NOT judging you for eating the diet.
2. They begin asking me what evidence I am relying on to determine if the plant diet is healthier out of concern for my health. I supply either [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org) videos or the studies themselves. Those get determined to be ""vegan bias"", despite the fact that science nor that website promotes veganism, and just promotes a plant based diet. But I dont push back at all, and I say ""ill look into your resources you provided, thanks, its also fine if we disagree, its okay!""
3. Certain people begin to link me more and more ""evidence"" that my diet is not healthier despite me never instigating a ""research war"". Either I dont respond and they get upset, or I respond.
4. Because I eventually respond to their research, they grow increasingly hostile to me by either not responding to me as often as they use to , or they outright tell me ""I dislike how often you are judging me for my diet, its not okay"". Despite the fact that I am never instigating it. 

It feels like me just not consuming animal products by choice results in me 100% of the time being considered an outcast , and I have people beginning to judge me no matter what I do.  


What do you do when you experience this clear persistent bias? Ive considered just straight up lying to people from now on. Instead of telling them I feel way better, I might just say ""I have a condition I dont want to discuss that requires me to consume no animal products, can we not bring this up?""  


This topic always results in some level of negativity if the person opposite to me consumes animal products. My mere PRESENCE of a plant based eater at a dinner table among friends will 100% of the time begin this pattern.  


Does anyone have advice? I dont have alot of family left alive, my entire immediate family either abused me or died.  


Disclaimer prior to venting: Research does not show that cancer is cured or solved or prevented in all cases by not consuming meat or animal products. Nor do the below statements indicate such. It merely is referring to the reduction in risk from a whole foods plant based diet.

Ps: Extended venting just because im sad tonight and miss him alot, and realized upon writing the question I needed to vent about missing him.  cancer killed my father. That was the main driver of me switching my diet. pancreatic cancer killed my father, and to be honest...he was in so much fucking pain....he died in sheer agony and it fucking broke my heart to see someone I love die like that. and i couldnt do a fucking thing no matter how often I tried to help him. And he REGRETTED EATING ANIMAL PRODUCTS at the end, and desperately tried to cling to life by switching to a plant based diet. but it was too late...because his body no longer could digest food properly because the cancer spread to his stomach....and he just sat there crying in the end: ""I can't even eat food anymore without 3 acid pills...and it still doesnt work and im in pain every time. I cant even eat, fiber is even worse. I hate this, i WISH i didnt eat those foods. I am being killed by the food i loved, and even in the end I cant eat it anymore, why me?""  


It was the most painful thing ive ever experienced in my entire life. I saw him slowly getting weaker and weaker.  More and more bones were crafting his image as the fat and muscle dissolved. His face looked like a skeleton, his arms looked like twigs, and his spirit died. And a week before he died, he was so deficient in calories from the lack of eating that his mind went away....and I just cried realizing I just lost my father forever...and I lost my chance to say goodbye to the man I loved and called my best friend.  


You handed him coffee. He would keep repeating ""can I have my coffee OP. Please?"" and no matter how many times you told him he had it, he would keep asking. And then you would call the ambulance to take him to the hospital and he puts up a massive fight because he doesnt realize hes sick ""im fine , im fine, stop, we cant afford this insurance costs. we dont have insurance to cover some of this, OP no you dont understand this is too much money. it will take me a decade to pay this back. please dont bankrupt me."" And you just dont have the heart to tell him: ""dad....it doesnt look like you are going to make it another week....the cost doesnt matter anymore....im sorry"".   


I see all this research showing the positive effects of plants and the negative effects of animal products. And I want to do everything in my power to prevent my future kids from ever having to suffer what I suffered through. to see someone they cared about dying in agony...to wake up one morning to see their parent staring at the cealing, breathing in small strained breaths, not able to respond to anything I say...realizing that this was it...saying goodbye. and having to sit with him for 2 HOURS while that strained breathing indicated he was going...but with no real timer to tell me when he would be gone....with a DNR order preventing me from trying to save him....I watched him fucking die for TWO FUCKING HOURS and couldnt do a dam fucking thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

was it worth it? no. he even admitted that. ""If I knew, if only I knew there was a chance this could be prevented, its so painful, every day is pain, why didnt I listen to the research, im so sorry OP, im sorry.""   


I miss him so much.   


I want to live to 120 so my kids never have to see me in that amount of pain, and im going to do everything in my power to increase the odds ill live that long.",1623196639

I've been experimenting with the convection feature on my oven to see if it might work like an air fryer.

I tossed three steamed gemstone potatoes, broccoli, bell pepper slices, and cherry tomatoes in a bit of broth, sprinkled seasoning over all of it, roasted it for about 25 minutes (my convection feature sets the oven at 350 degrees).

I served it over steamed quinoa and added a bit of sriracha. The cherry tomatoes were GLORIOUS and sweet, the broccoli had a crispy crunch to it, and the potatoes were nice and soft with a light, crispy skin.

PlantBasedDiet,Difficult eating plant-based in small farm town.,"I want to eat completely plant based, but it’s really difficult to do when you live in a small farm town, and the one(s) you live with and cook for, demand meat. I’ve been toying with a plant based diet off and on and it never sticks. 

I don’t mind if my fiancé eats meat, but it’s another extra thing to cook. And although I have access to most fruits and veggies, and at least a few meat substitutes, it’s still really hard to maintain my motivation to stay plant-based because everyone I know eats animal products and there isn’t much for plant-based options when we go out to eat (which really isn’t that often but still). I’m also addicted to cheese, so that’s been really hard to quit and the vegan cheeses available here are really gross. 

I love the taste of plant based foods, but the temptation for meat and dairy is too much sometimes because it’s usually the easier option. How did you guys make the final transition?",1622691422

PlantBasedDiet,Starting to cook WFPB in a dorm (3 qt instant pot),"I'm trying to go more WFPB over this summer, which should be relatively easy. I don't think I'll get to fully WFPB but I'm hoping to reach about 80-90% by doing 100% WFPB breakfasts and lunches and then eating with my parents in the evenings - they do Purple Carrot and a lot of eating out. I think I'll eat the purple carrot with them, do my best with ordering at restaurants, and sometimes make my own dinners.

The real problem is that I'm going back to college in the fall and I'll need to make a mini kitchen in my dorm because the dining hall doesn't have much in the way of plant based options. There's one veggie/sometimes vegan station but it servers the same dish for both lunch and dinner and isn't always my type of food. 

I'm planning on setting up a mini kitchen in my dorm. I have a 3 qt mini instant pot and a kettle and the room comes with a nice mini fridge (separate freezer compartment) and microwave.

As I was leaving my appointment there was another gentleman finishing his and he was excited and his doctor was saying how well his A1C was. In the parking lot I made a decision to chat him up on what he was doing. He told me to “watch Forks Over Knives and get moving”.

As of today I’m 87lbs down and they took me off metformin this afternoon . We have slowly been tapering me down to ensure it was my lifestyle and not the medication. 

I also changed my Drs opinion on how to treat diabetes, at least in my case, it clearly worked. Food is thy medicine , right? 

I became the other guy today leaving his appointment with a smile on my face and looking to help someone else.

I’m 100% positive this lifestyle saved my life.

PlantBasedDiet,"10 days into WFPB, coming from keto. Struggling with macros/protein.","Hi everyone! I recently switched from a ketogenic diet to WFPB. It was pretty much an overnight switch, so I didn't have a period to ease in. I've tried being vegan before, but wasn't doing it correctly (still ate lots of refined carbs, etc.).

My first and foremost goal is to be as healthy as possible. I'm done with dietary hacks and obsessing about the scale. I know that if eat in a clean and healthy way, I'll loose weight.

Now I'm trying to tune my macros/diet.

About me: 35 yo, 238lbs. Moderately active (3-5 days/week).

Using the [TDEE Calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/) suggested in r/loseit, these are the suggested macros (using a 30/20/50 High Carb pattern):

* Maintenance: 2,544 calories/day
* Cutting: 2,044 calories/day
* Protein: 153g
* Fats: 43g
* Carbs: 255g

I'm using Cronometer to log what I eat, but I'm still struggling to meet my protein needs, even after having some protein powder (which I'm not a big fan of, I'd rather stay off it if possible).

I'm also trying to do 16/8 IF but so far I'm reconsidering if the ketogenic effects of IF are really worth the overeating I have to do at breakfast and lunch.

A typical day of eating looks like this:

* Breakfast: 
    - Oats &amp; fruit
        - 50g rolled oats
        - 10g pecans
        - 10g walnuts
        - 5g almonds
        - 1/2 tbsp chia seeds
        - 1/2 tbsp hemp seeds
        - 1/2 tbsp flax seed
        - 1/2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
        - 30g blueberries
        - 60-70g strawberries (4)
        - A few goji berries
    - Smoothie
        - 1 cup of sugar-free almond milk
        - 1/2 banana
        - 1 big scoop of peanut butter
        - 2 scoops of Orgain protein powder
* Lunch
    - 80g black beans
    - 80g lentils
    - 80g chickpeas or hummus
    - 80g quinoa
    - 80g brown rice
    - 1 potato
    - Salad or cooked veggies (dark leafy greens, tomato, mushrooms, etc.).
    - Avocado (1/2 of a small one or 1/4 of a large one).

My issue here is that, after eating all of that, I'm still at ~1,500 calories and 70g of protein (and that's considering that Cronometer overcounts the calories in oatmeal by a factor of 3, so realistically I'm having some 200 less calories than what Cronometer says, and adding the smoothie which I didn't have initially). I don't feel hungry by dinner time, but I kind of try to eat something to bump up my protein intake. However, I don't want to force feed myself.

[Here are my Cronometer stats](https://imgur.com/a/gOohbZU)

Any suggestions on how I can improve my meals? Should I eat until I feel full or do I need to grow a bigger stomach to process all those delicious plants? Or might there be something wrong about the way I'm logging in my calories? 

Any help would be super appreciated!",1622580834

So i’ve been eating plant based and being vegan for almost a year now. it’s been great and the only way of eating that has allowed me to... actually *eat.* But I want to transition to a full WFPB diet.

Even though lettuce/spinach/kale/salad greens are oh-so-healthy, they do not receive the orthorexia seal of approval because I’ve had the “dirty dozen” concept drilled into me so bad I can’t even LOOK at spring mix without thinking of pesticides or e.coli. 

I feel like I could eat these things if I had a “better way” of washing them. That’s what gets me caught up in my head, that I can’t remove enough of the “bad stuff” to make it safe.

I’ve been vegan for nine years but have moved into a WFPB diet two months ago after reading How Not to Die. In the book Gregor hints to alcohol being linked to cancer but I kind of ignored it, as I do love a couple beers a week (and a few drinks on a Friday night).

However, I recently dove deeper into alcohol by watching all the videos/reading all the studies about how alcohol is actually a carcinogen. A potentially big one, too. So I decided I would cut it out, or at least reduce it dramatically. This whole week was easy up until tonight (Friday) when my boyfriend and some friends and I went out to dinner. Craved a beer but not bad. But then afterwards they all wanted to go to another bar where live music was playing, so we went and I kept drinking my soda waters, but I could tell how much looser and bubbly they were than me, and I started to feel left out? And then a beer sounded REALLY good. This sounds ridiculous to type out but here we are. 

I know r/stopdrinking exists but from what I can tell that mostly appeals to people who are recovering addicts. I’m not addicted, I just enjoy the refreshment and feeling of a beer on a Friday night, and I’m wondering if anyone has any advice/experience after giving it up strictly for health purposes.

Personally, I like to eat high protein without adding too much protein shakes/supplements, but that's been kind of a crutch for me at this point. I tried the protein/meal replacement Huel, since it seems to be pretty decently close to wfpb, but have a hard time just living off that. Two of the main challenges I've run into are that the hotels often just have a fridge and microwave (if even that), and that many places I travel to just have the basics at a grocery store or Walmart.

Any thoughts or recipes would be really appreciated, and hopefully this post can help other people that have to travel too!",1622151594

PlantBasedDiet,Eating mostly whole foods plant-based changed my body composition and fixed my gut issues," 

I'm only 95% plant-based so I hope this isn't an issue. If it is, feel free to delete.

Anyway, I just started a few months ago due to health reasons (autoimmune condition - eczema, gut issues, and hormonal imbalance)

I've been eating mostly legumes, rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and a lot of fruit. And holy crap, what a difference this diet has made in my life.

First of all, my gut health hasn't been this good in a while. Antibiotic usage from a few years ago completely destroyed my gut health and I was suffering from a lot of food intolerances but now I've been able to successfully incorporate all those foods back into my diet (nightshades, gluten, grains, etc)

Second of all, my skin looks amazing now (during the first few weeks I had horrible skin breakouts after reintroducing some foods, but it went away). Now, I haven't had any major eczema flare-ups and the horrible chin acne I've been having on and off for years has completely gone away without any acne medication.

And third, I'm at the leanest I've ever been in my life.

I've been pretty active for a while now, but I just haven't been able to shed the fat. I had also been dealing with some hormonal issues, which I suspect was one of the reasons for not being able to shed some fat.

FYI, I'm still currently at the same weight, my body composition just changed. I'm so much leaner now and I can finally see muscle definition.

What's crazy is I haven't changed my exercise routine, I actually workout less now, and I even eat a lot of white rice and noodles. Yet the fat is just coming off so easily now!

Taking the plant-based route has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life. And btw, the book Fiber Fueled brought me to this point. So thank you Dr. Will Bulsiewicz! If you haven't read that book yet, go pick it up now! Worth every penny and time.

If anyone's interested in my journey, here's an article I wrote!

PlantBasedDiet,Anyone else itchy??,"Hi Everyone! I began eating plant based at the start of the year, and loving everything about it, except one thing: my skin is incredibly itchy. It began a couple of months ago and has been on and off since then. I’m pretty convinced it’s due to the diet, as I’ve never had a similar feeling before; however, I’m not eating anything that I haven’t eaten before. I am, on the other hand, eating more tofu, beans, whole grains, fruit, and vegetables than before, so hard to narrow down.

For reference, I’m 26M, 165 lbs., with no preexisting conditions. I’d be surprised if I had a deficiency - I’m eating way healthier than before, hitting the daily dozen most days, get b-12 from my daily plant milk, take a multi-vitamin and vitamin-d daily, the occasional extra b-12. 

If it helps, this is my standard daily meal plan (with mild variations)

Breakfast: Rolled Oats with plant (soy or oat) milk, chia seeds, flax seeds, banana, a dash of peanut butter and a few dark chocolate chips or cacao powder.

Mid-morning snack: An apple.

Lunch: generally a meal prepped with whole grains (brown rice or quinoa), beans (black or chickpeas), and vegetables. My go-to’s are lentil stew, burrito bowls, pasta with chickpeas and veggies.

Afternoon snacks: carrots or cucumbers and hummus, occasional dark chocolate, maybe some more fruit, and the occasional handful of chips (I know, not WFPB).

Dinner: Big smoothie with lots of greens (usually broccoli, spinach, and/or kale), vegan protein powder or Huel, blueberries, turmeric, avocados, sometimes hemp/chia.

Hope this detail helps!

Has anyone had similar symptoms and found the cause? I’ve seen similar posts but none where those involved found a solution.

I suspect it’s a mild allergy to soy or something, as antihistamines tend to improve my symptoms.",1621915046

PlantBasedDiet,How to unwind years of binge eating and extreme dieting?,"35m 380lbs  


I've been trying to adopt a WFPB diet for about 4 years now, but after 20+ years of binge eating I find I keep falling into the same loop.  


1. Eat WFPB for 1-3 days.
2. Feel cravings for unhealthy food (sugar, oil, refined flour, fried food)
3. Binge eat for 3-14 days (almost all meals are junk, takeout, etc.)
4. Feel bad enough to try and restart
5. Either restart with a varied WFPB diet or, more often, attempt a strict monodiet (potato fast)  

6. Go to 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand all the science behind this - how dopamine signaling plays into binge eating, how taste buds affect signaling and how long it takes for taste buds to reset to lower levels of palatability, how the gut biome affects mental health... but I cannot seem to get over the hump of 21 or 30 days or however long it takes. For those 1-3 days it takes real effort, a fight with each meal, and then I wear out. Or, I feel OK with the meals but I get frustrated that i don't feel better and I give up because it seems pointless.  


Can anyone relate? Has anyone overcome this? When I go to this reddit and loseit I see lots of stories from people who are not that fat or don't have binge eating issues talking about how easy this is, but I want to hear stories from people who actually have the same level of dysregulation as I do.

PlantBasedDiet,Please tweak my diet. Am I eating too much fat?,"As the title says, please tweak my daily diet. Overall my energy level feels great, but I would like some input. 

Breakfast (6am): Larabar with a small coffee with either a splash of oatmilk or almond milk 

*I workout after this, which is why the meal is so small

Brunch/Lunch (10:30am): Smoothie with oats, Zucchini/Yellow Squash/other vegetable, leafy greens, banana, and berries, and a scoop of almond butter 

Snack (3pm): Ezekiel Bread OR Mary's Crackers with sliced veggies with some kind of homemade hummus or bean dip, and some fruit if I'm still hungry

Dinner (6pm): Varies. Typically based in beans/lentils, a grain, a bunch of vegetables, and a fat such as avocado or a nut based sauce. 


My biggest concern is eating too much fat. However, when I cut out my scoop of almond butter at lunch time, I feel extremely sluggish. I think this is my body telling me that the fats from the almond butter are needed, but I'm not sure. All cholesterol numbers and bloodwork is great.

PlantBasedDiet,Digestive issues after being fully plant based for nearly 2 years?,"All my life I have been blessed with an amazing digestive system and i could eat anything without issues.

2 years ago i went fully plant based and as I am health focused it means there was no junk food etc but just whole plant foods.

I like to do a bit of exercise each day and for a few months of the year i will also focus on full body muscle building to maintain a decent core.

Because of this getting enough protein is important to me. Im not talking over 1gram per kg in weight, but a decent 0.7 or 0.8g per kg as I have a big frame from someone whos 5 foot 8.

So naturally I would vary my protien to try and insure i was getting enough amino acid types that i could make complete protiens etc.

This worked great until a month or 2 ago when i started to have great pain all around my digestive system and it would swell up bad and have a lot of trapped gas. This could last for a few hours of pain and I woild have to try walk it off. Also some bad wc would happen and i would eat light and ot would be ok then. 

I loved eating a lot of lentils and chic peas and beans for my protien but these seem to be the key culprits. I cut them out for a few weeks and had no issues and i started to slowly added them back in with a small amount of beans yesterday and today and today it flared up again. 

My fear is now I will have to start eating fish like sardins mackeral and salmon again in order to get the protien ans iron etc I need and want as my favourite sources no longer seem to agree with my gut. And that leaves with with very few options for making complete protiens by mixing amino acids from the other plant based proteins that remain.

PlantBasedDiet,I need help with kid food.,"There's never going to be a perfect diet for my kid who is currently 5. Mom and dad have 50/50 custody and the other parent simply is not going to cut out the cheesy pizza diet. I've tried talking about it and got a ""well im glad she gets her carrots at your house"" response.

 I can get her to eat some fruits and veggies, mostly fruit since its sugary and like candy/ ice cream which she's constantly begging for. Carrots and broccoli gets eaten, but only with ranch. I've tried cooking them all sorts of ways. 

I just made cheezy chickpeas. They taste like macaroni and cheese and she still cried about them and will not eat them. I asked what she wamts on them. More salt? More pepper? Ketchup? Ranch? Nope... She wants pepperonis on them. Honestly, I wish I had them on hand to get her to eat. 

I dont mind compromising. Im not trying to be a religious fanatic when it comes to this diet. If a few pepperonis gets her to eat some overall healthy food, whatever... I already cook two seperate meals at times just to make sure she eats something. She's always been a low percentile weight (long before I committed to not eating crap).

 Her doctor recommended booster shakes. So even on my stricter nights where i'm adamant that she ""eat your dinner or go to bed without dinner"" i end up caving. Let's face it. This lifestyle is fanatical to the general population. If she loses even more weight and I tell the doc and other parent im not feeding her dinner unless it's plants... Even I'd call it neglect. A diet of pizza a chicken nuggets should be considered abuse, but it simply isn't. 

Maybe a parenting sub could provide better tips on getting a kid to eat in general, but if anyone has tips for healthy meals that taste better than macaroni and cheese... I'm open.

Tldr: I'm like every other parent in the world that can't get their kid to freaking eat dinner. Give me some tips to trick her into eating something healthy.

PlantBasedDiet,Absolute beginner to planning meals. How do I do it?,"18M here.

**TLDR:** Just the title. Also, tips for eating and buying cheaply would also be appreciated.

**Context**

Currently, here's why I tend to eat on a regular basis.

For **breakfast**, I usually eat 4 slices of bread with peanut butter (outside of what I use on the bread, I eat about 3 scoops). Another option includes oatmeal.

For **lunch**, I either eat the same thing, or cereal with soy milk. On rare times, we would get takeout as well.

For **dinner**, I eat rice. Or the same thing I had for breakfast.

For **snacks**, I eat fruit, crackers and occasionally peanuts or lettuce.

(I also eat multivitamins on a semi-regular basis)

As you can tell, my diet is pretty shitty.

Since I began to become vegan (not for health reasons, but for ethical ones), and out of a desire to be a functional adult, I've started to research how to eat healthy.

I decided to divide my diet into 5 food groups and 4 meals.

*Food Groups*

* Fruit
* Vegetables
* Whole Grains
* Legumes
* Nuts &amp; Seeds

*Meals*

* Breakfast
* Lunch
* Snacks
* Dinner

I've also done research on the slew of nutrients I need for a healthy diet.

**Problem**

My main issues with my diet are the following:

* It lacks in variety in terms of food groups (mostly Grains)
* It's probably deficient in nutrients or calories.
* I tend to eat the same thing a lot of the time.

As a result, I want to be more educated on planning meals for my health and general well-being.

But I'm an absolute beginner when to meal planning.

* I don't plan my meals ahead of time, which I know would cause issues in the long run.
* I've researched the food groups and nutrients involved in a healthy vegan diet, but I don't know how to coherently combine all of these into balanced meals, or an actual plan.
* I've realized that I haven't really ""explored the food world,"" which I believe is one of the reasons why my diet is so monotonous. I typically think ""bread, oatmeal"" for breakfast, and ""sandwich, rice"" for lunch and dinner. I never really had foods like ""soups"", ""casseroles"", ""salads"", ""stews"", ""burritos"" or stuff like that before. I never really tried that many vegetables or beans either. I've never tried tofu or tempeh before as well. There are thousands of other foods/meals out there, and I'm unfamiliar with many of them. This is something I would like to improve on.
* I don't know how to cook. Although, I have recently learned how to make oatmeal.

I would like to know how to plan my meals. Tips for eating and shopping cheaply would also be appreciated.",1620878966
PlantBasedDiet,Bit of an issue with the amount of pulp...help!,"Okay, so here's what's going on. Initially, I was just making a quart of mixed nut milk and I'd use the pulp to make a cheese and eat it with some cookies I make and everything was fine. The volume of pulp was manageable and I found a good use for it.

I then started making the almond-sesame seed-rice yogurt /u/iLoveSev had posted about earlier. Problem? I'm making double the amount (I want to ideally eat some yogurt after both lunch and dinner, so even double the recipe amount will only last me two days or so) and I'm using brown/red rice (rather than the white rice used there), which means I'm getting a ridiculous amount of pulp from this. Okay, no problem. I'll just start putting pulp into my pancakes in the morning. This is getting to be a problem, but I think I can make this work.

Then, I realized that I'm using about a cup of my mixed nut milk a day for the pancakes, which means that the milk is disappearing twice as quickly (I usually drink about a cup of it with my chai in the morning). I decided to make sunflower seed milk instead for the pancakes (since I'm not made of money). This, I think, crosses an inflection point.

I'm currently sitting with the pulp from the last time I made the yogurt, *this* time I made the yogurt, and the sunflower seed milk I just made. On top of this, I'm sitting on the cheese from the last quart of nut milk I made (which I finished in two days...). I'm at the point where I'm not even sure how to store all this pulp, let alone use it. I live by myself and don't really bake a lot (at least, not things that would normally use flour), so I can't sub in the pulp. I'll try increasing the amount of pulp I put in my breakfast pancakes, but the volume is getting to be quite large.

Ideas for how to deal with this gigantic volume of pulp?",1620870789

PlantBasedDiet,"All praise to the simple, endlessly tweakable banana-oat-nutmilk pancakes","So, I've taken the regular banana oat nutmilk pancakes and started playing with them to see how nutritionally dense I can make them.

1. 1 cup rolled oats
2. 1/2 cup leftover pulp from making almond-sesame seed-rice yogurt
3. 3 tbsp chia seeds
4. 3 tbsp sesame seeds
5. 1 medium banana
6. 1 cup nutmilk
7. Mystery ingredient for variety (blueberries, cacao, etc)

I usually run the oats and chia seeds first through the food processor to break them down before adding the rest of the ingredients. This amount usually makes 2 medium-to-large pancakes (they come out much larger because of the extra pulp). The pancakes come out delicious and there's endless variety because of ingredient number 7. The nutmilk amount is increased here because of the chia seeds, since otherwise the batter will be too dry.

Based on just the oats, bananas, and seeds, I get:

1. at least 25 grams of protein
2. at least 26 grams of fiber
3. at least 29 grams of healthy fats
4. about 40% or so of the daily intake for calcium

I have not included the nutrition content for the fiber (not sure exactly what's in it and what makes it into the milk), nutmilk (depends on how you make it or what brand you buy), or the mystery ingredient (because it's, well, a mystery). All told, it's likely over 1000 calories, especially if you make fairly thick nutmilk like I do. But the nutrition definitely makes it worth it, and I'm not too concerned about the calories.",1620844718

PlantBasedDiet,Food Miles and Sustainability Questions,"Hi guys, I would love some input on how you deal with food miles and the carbon emissions of your diets. I haven't eaten farmed animal products in about 7 years, but in that time I was hunting and spearfishing to ensure my protein sources were as low impact and sustainable as possible.

Recently, my wife (who was vegan before we met and began eating my harvested animal products soon after we started dating on her own volition) has decided she would like to return to a strictly plant based diet. By default I have hung up my speargun and bow and gladly matched her diet.

I am a freelancer with lots of spare time and do all of the cooking and shopping for us. I love cooking and eating a plant based diet but recently I have begun to struggle with the packaging and food miles behind every source of protein I can find.

Living the most harmonious with nature and lowest carbon footprint lifestyle is what matters most to me and the amount of packaging and food miles behind beans, tofu, tempeh, protein powders, nuts, legumes, and everything else I can think of to buy for us is so disheartening. It feels like I was living much more harmoniously with the local environment when I was selectively harvesting it myself. 

Going in to shops and buying big bags of beans that were factory farmed and shipped countless miles feels like it must be doing so much harm to many different ecosystems before it ends up on my plate. I end up feeling grossed out and sad by the food I cook.

Am I overreacting? Am I missing a protein source? Can someone link an up to date peer reviewed paper about the impact of the production and transportation of common vegan protein sources? 

For context, I find all meat farming to be deplorable and realize that hunting and gathering is not a sustainable practice for most of the world's population. I will forever support all of those who do not consume animal products and believe the world would be a better and greener place if livestock farming was replaced with other means of protein production. Also, I forage lots of our food  while I'm out at work or climbing (mostly mushrooms and green leafy stuff at this time of year) and we grow as much veg and legumes as we can.

More than anything I do not want to turn this into an argument about ethics and morals. I just want in making personal dietary choices that cause the very least impact on the world around me. Thanks for reading this and for any help or input you may be able to give to me!",1620812892

I'm trying to find recipes my grandma will like, and one of the things I've noticed is that she struggles to eat certain textures. She doesn't like grain bowls, for example, because they get stuck in her teeth.

We make a pseudo pizza that she loves, because it has a bread base. I've made a greens burger that she really likes because it ended up with a really meaty texture. She likes pasta because it's larger than grains while also being softer and ""nicer"" to bite. But I honestly can't eat pasta all the time, so I'm looking for some more ideas.

PlantBasedDiet,Is it bad to order hulled hempseeds in hot weather?,"I'm facing a dilemma, i discovered myprotein recently and they sell hempseeds for cheap and offee fast shipping to where i live, however they have a lot of great discounts yearly, the current one is probably the lowest, it ends on may 25.

Should i wait till may 25 and continue waiting for a considerably better discount or should i bulk order for around 70 dollars (total of 3,200 grams of hempseeds).

I could use some omega 3 in my diet, I hate blending flaxseeds however when i cook i add them a tbsp at the end, idk if slightly cooking them helps with digesting them, does it? 

Anyway i know that regardless whole flaxseeds are still greatly beneficial, for the gut.

I don't think I'd have a problem waiting for a better discount, but summer is coming, weather is getting hotter, shipping will take around 2 weeks i think.

If im gonna bulk order and the hot weather is gonna degrade the hempseeds then i may as well just order them now instead of waiting to save some money.

I'm buying them not just for omega 3 but also because they're low in net carbs and extremely heigh in nutrients, not that i have anything against carbs, it's just because i have a cavity that i need to go get fixed at the dentist.",1620456580

PlantBasedDiet,Thoughts on maqui berries?,"They're said to be the number 1 superfruit that's most supported by science, they have the most potent anthocyanins, way more than acai which are said to be overrated in comparison and not as supported by science.

The reason im asking is I'm ordering acerola cherry freeze dried powder from a store, they also sell maqui berry powder too.

Why powder?

I don't eat berries, they're sour and they're bad for my teeth, i have cavities and i can't go to the dentist in at least over a month, plus i hate berries anyway, blackberries are way too sour, so are raspberries, blueberries being the least so but still very sour and not that good tasting.

Maybe the fresh ones are better but it's hard to find those, mostly they sell frozen bags of these where i live.

Anyway the price for 250 grams of maqui berry freeze dried powder is 27 dollars, adjusted with the shipping price they'd probably cost around 35 dollars? 

It's 27 for maqui, and around 29 for acerola (contains more than daily requirement of vitamin c per 1 dried gram). And as for the shipping it's 14 dollars.


I would be taking around half a gram of freeze dried maqui a day, in the form of a capsule which I'll be filling myself, as to prevent the berry powder from coming into contact with my teeth and lowering the ph of my mouth.

Half a gram is very little but I'm sure since it's very potent it'd be more than enough to make a difference.

As for acerola it'd be half a gram to a gram.

I would probably up the dose of the maqui to a gram but it'd mean swallowing more capsules or bigger capsules, I'm like yeah i won't bother, at the same time I'll save money.

The berry powder ends up cheap, because it's like 35 usd but 250 grams would last at least a year, so 35 usd for at least a year is not much.

I know the supplement industry is highly unregulated and in general most people don’t need to take supplements. But since I’m plant-based and don’t get much sun exposure, I take a B12 and D3 supplement as per Greger’s (and others’) recommendations. I even remember him citing the brand Nature’s Made as a legit source because it’s USP verified. Fwiw, the B12 one doesn’t have gelatin in it. And now that I look closer the D3 bottle doesn’t have the little USP seal like the B12 does. 

So I guess this is a warning to check ingredients on everything; including supplements.

However, taking a quick look at the group, it seems my diet is a bit different from what most people seems to be doing.
My dietitian's advice has been:
-I should include veggies in every dish, the more the merrier.
-Carbs and veggies have to take up at least 2/3 of the plate.
-The protein has to take up a 1/3 or 1/4 of the plate.
-BUT! (and this is the ""different part""), I can only have ONE source of carbs and ONE source of protein in the same dish. For example, if I cook lentils, I couldn't stew the lentils with a potato because that would count as ""two sources of carbs"". Likewise, I can make myself a ham and tomato sandwich, but not a ham and cheese sandwich.

Is there any scientific evidence for doing this, sticking to just ONE foodstuff of each ""category""?

The autopsy reports and medical histories of all individuals &gt; or =100 years, dying unexpectedly out of hospital, were gathered from 42,398 consecutive autopsies, performed over a period of 18 years at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Vienna. These records were evaluated with regard to age and sex, circumstances of death, season, time and the cause of death, as well as the presence of any other comorbidity.

RESULTS:
Forty centenarians (11 men, 29 women) were identified with a median age of 102 +/- 2.0 (range: 100-108) years. Sixty percent were described as having been healthy before death. However, an acute organic failure causing death was found in 100%, including cardiovascular diseases in 68%, respiratory illnesses in 25%, gastrointestinal disorders in 5%, and cerebrovascular disease in 2%. Additionally, centenarians suffered from several comorbidities (cardiac antecedents, neurologic disorders, liver diseases, cholecystolithiasis), which were not judged to be the cause of death.

CONCLUSIONS:
Centenarians, though perceived to have been healthy just prior to death, succumbed to diseases in 100% of the cases examined. They did not die merely ""of old age."" The 100% post mortem diagnosis of death as a result of acute organic failure justifies autopsy as a legal requirement for this clinically difficult age group.

PlantBasedDiet,Weight Loss/Calories/Starch Solution,"Hi All! 

I have switched to a mostly WFPB diet approach to eating! I have about 25 pounds of weight to lose (I’m switching to more endurance style training from a more strength training approach). I’m on the highest end of my BMI but have a lot of muscle mass. I’m 5’7 F and 158 pounds.

I decided to adopt the Starch Solution approach for the time being as it seems to really work for people. I was just wondering as I’ve tracked calories on a few days - I’m eating 1200-1400 calories a day - which is very LITTLE calorie wise for me (my TDEE is between 2300-2400). But I feel full and satiated. 

Does anyone know if I continue to eat very low calories for around 3-4 months and under my BMR - if it will severely impact my metabolism once I’ve reached my weight goal? Will this cause problems/will I have to slowly increase calories for a long time after? Or am I overthinking it and underestimating the adaptability of the human body? 

TLDR:
I want to lose 25 pounds. Does eating mostly intuitively and being below your BMR and relatively low calorie cause long term negative implications? If this is only for a few months and you don’t feel under fuelled.",1619940001

PlantBasedDiet,"How does fat burn off on high carb like McDougal diet when insulin prevents it , is it thermogenesis ?","Hi, new to this community.

I been reading and watchinf videos and I cant seem to find this soecific anawer.

So this is what ai understand (maybe you can correct me too).  When you eat carbs, turns to glycogen, goes into blood stream and insulin comes in. Sugar is stored first into muscles, then Liver, ans rest as fat.

So, if all the carbs, plant based that is, I eat, is used up from moving/exercises/or sleeping(thermogenesis), then insulin  takes sugar from muscles (assuming im eating proteins chickpeas too etc), it would be burned off first, then liver sugars is burned off. 

So, if in eating alot of good carbs, how is my stored fat from many many years, will burn off if insulin keeps burning my sugars and not my fat ? 

I can think of the laws of thermodynamics (thermogenesis) ,if im eating so much of the water density plant based carbs, im getting full so less calories and therefore, the rest would be  my stored fat ? And if so, is that from walking, some exercise and fidgeting and sleeping all mixed together to burn it ?

Hope this makes sense 🙃",1619887902

None of these are set stone, but to try and give this idea some context I was thinking something along the lines of:

1. Form a group of 4 to 6 people
2. Commit to the group for a set period (6, 10, 12 weeks?)
3. Post next weeks meal plans somewhere (a dedicated subreddit?)
4. Participate in a weekly group chat or call to celebrate wins, provide some friendly accountability where things are slipping and to solve problems and challenges together
5. There's not just one way to go WFPB ... some might be going all in for every meal, while others in the group might be changing just one meal a day

I am a very amateur programmer but I created this web application that lets you search for a specific term on all the Live Q&amp;As in microseconds.

PlantBasedDiet,Eating a plant based diet is making me sick? How can I fix this?,"So I’m 21. I’ve recently started eating more plant based. Im not eating like this for moral reasons but more so for health reasons. I also probably eat meat like once a week but very little. I’ve been eating like this for about a month and have noticed that my foot itches a lot, is dry (looks white flaky), and looks a bit bruised from some angles, it runs form the bottom of my toe and spans to the edge of my heel. This worried me and I searched up what possibly could be causing it, upon my searches I found that it could be diabetes. I feel it is the carbs that I am eating. 

My eating time is from 12-8pm, sometimes it’s as short as 5-8pm because sometimes I work very late and don’t bring anything to snack on. 

My diet consists of 1 cup oatmeal, 1-1/2 cup of berries, plant based milks, carrots, 3-4 baked potatoes (no oil, no nothing), cucumbers, nuts and seeds, and greens. Maybe once a week I’ll eat meat but very little, only on Saturday and Sunday do I have the most time. I don’t eat beans because they take a while to cook even though I have a pressure cooker, usually when I get back it’ll be 4-5 so within in an hour it’s 6 (I also leave for work pretty early). Since I eat very late the earliest being like 3 I try to eat the most I can between 3/5 - 8pm, but this is very hard considering how large in volume the foods are. I don’t want to eat very little because I fear it’ll make me weak and lead to much more drastic consequences. I fear I have perhaps reached diabetes as a consequence of eating like this. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not and don’t  know what to do. I keep telling myself it’s just temporary but things seem to just be getting worse.",1619155074

PlantBasedDiet,Thoughts on triphala?,"Triphala is super super healthy, it contains really high anti oxidant fruits, amla being one of them, together they're more effective than alone.

I'm interested in triphala for several reasons but mainly due to it's effects oj cavities, it has been studied and has been shown to be effective in combatting cavities.

Another reason that makes it very interesting is it's cost, it's very inexpensive, that's not usually the cade for such things, many super foods are overpriced, with triphala you get a lot of bang for your buck.

I'm surprised with it's studied health benefits and it's price it's not so popular, why is that?

I do know that people hate the taste, it can't be that bad, certainly not as bad as kava kava which is the worst thing i tried, yes worse than wheat grass powder juice, which is very very disgusting.

I mean, it's just some fruit mix, they say sour, astringent, sweet and bitter at the same time.. i have to try and see for myself.

I'm not strong when it comes to eating disgusting things, i threw away the wheatgrass container i bought after tasting it.

However with triphala im convinced i can make it tolerable, or maybe just maybe i can make myself like it, at least over time, like how people hate beer the first time they try it then they start liking it?


also any thoughts on heavy metals in triphala?",1619129850

As far as I am concerned my taking pumpkin seed oil gives me an edge over any vegan who is not taking it.

All I substituted was the cream cheese with Daiya cream cheese (using the same amount) and as for the eggs, I whisked together flaxseeds and water (using the amount that would convert to two eggs) and let it sit until it got slimy. When I poured the batter into the graham cracker crust, it was very thick and creamy.

https://news.osu.edu/omega-3-supplements-do-double-duty-in-protecting-against-stress/


Any thoughts?

I haven't seen evidence to support that ala intake increases dha and epa, however the study was conducted on meat eaters who still consumed the same diet they were eating except they just added linseed oil.

Maybe because of that their body just relies on dietary dha and epa so it doesn't try to convert ala, we have seen how the body adapts to stuff, so maybe when we stop consuming dha and epa we become better at converting ala to epa and dha?

I wish there were more studies on this, something that could help support that ALA intake can result in same benefits.

i may try to lower omega 6 intake by a lot (i already only eat only whole food sources of fat) and increase omega 3 intake and wait while we find out more about ala in the future.",1618938659

What I could really use is a simple list I can buy when I shop that allows me to make many different meals, and would also be available at my rural grocery store. Also I am looking for a resource for good recipes that have a lot of flavor. We can eat more plainly that we are accustomed to with our high fat high salt, plenty of meat diet but its hard to transition straight to plain food and many recipes I find are bland.

PlantBasedDiet,Simple WFPB curry simmer sauce?,"When I first went WFPB I did a lot of curries, but I went off that when I realized the Trader Joes curry sauce I was using was chock full of coconut. (Tastes great, but yeah probably 80% of *non*\-WFPB diet RDA of saturated fat in a single meal :-)

Over this weekend, I made a vegetable/Tofu curry using one of the Patak's simmer sauces that seemed fairly low in fat (just like 3% saturated fat, though probably closer to 10% since I used about three servings). They do list coconut and also canola oil as ingredients. All I did was cut up carrots and a potato, put them in a fry pan with just enough water to come close to covering them, waited until the water partly boiled off then added the Tofu and simmer sauce and some diced green chiles (from a can) and simmered some more.  

I really enjoyed it, and it is an easy three+ servings of beans plus lots of veggies. *But*, I would like to make my own WFPB simmer sauce. I know there are recipes online, but they always seem to have a lot of ingredients and seem complex (I'm not much of a chef). Is there a basic 3-4 ingredient curry simmer sauce I could mix up and have available? Just looking at ""curry"" on Wikipedia seems like the main ingredients are turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and fresh or dried chilies (and probably water to make it a liquid) but I have no idea of the ratios, or if one or two of those could be left out while still tasting good (I'm looking for simplicity here). The chiles could be left out of the sauce and added when simmering as I did before. I know there are pre-mixed curry powders out there but the compositions seem all over the place, and I'd like to not be tied to a single pre-mixed curry brand. 

Any recipes, or links to recipes, for a truly simple WFPB curry simmer sauce that could be mixed up and stuck in the fridge for a week or two? Thanks in advance for any ideas.",1618849349

PlantBasedDiet,Confirmation bias,"Every couple of months I like challenging my own ideas and beliefs, so I search for evidence *against* a whole food plant based diet (amongst other topics). I try to find science-based info, peer-reviewed articles, university based research results, and so on, but I also read from more mainstream sources (my business is in this field, so I want to be up to date with what most people read).

The purpouse is to NOT end up reading Dr. Greger's opinion or any of our old-time favourites', as that would defeat the aim of the exercise.

It often ends up being about [anti-nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/anti-nutrients/), and this time in particular it was all about lectins. A couple of articles got me almost worried and questioning things (before I found out they were linked to Dr Steven Gundry), but a better look around and another little while spent reading online article put my heart back to rest.

Interesting how you get a feeling from the type of words used if the author is trying to sensationalize an aspect of our diet and basically scare people away. Usually 'absolute' words are a big red flag (today reading about ""killer lectins"" gave me a giggle - [https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-high-in-lectins](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-high-in-lectins))

In conclusion, lectins are unavoidable and if properly processed not harmful at all, actually beneficial:

&gt;Avoiding lectins altogether would mean avoiding almost all plant foods, which would mean avoiding a majority of the foods that the longest-lived people in the world consumed every day of their lives as well as the foods shown to reduce risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Cooking properly, soaking, or buying canned beans protect you from digestive discomfort and potential harm.

PlantBasedDiet,Help with fast dense protein,"Hi all,

So I need a little help with getting protein in, quickly, in a meal. Ideally in solid form. 

For background, I’m doing about 40 miles plus a week trail running over broken ground and I’ve been feeling a bit weak. Looking back at food intake, I really think lack of protein is the likely issue. 

While there are lot of nuts, peas and peanut butter in the diet, I think the problem is that at dinner there is not a solid chunk of protein. There are like peas and walnuts in the pasta, but it ain’t cutting it. 

Now I think I could try and shovel down some protein powder as a last resort, but it’s not something I’ve ever loved. 

So, any like veggie croquettes or similar that I can drop on top of the pasta, or other protein dense thing to get that protein hit?

Thanks for your time.",1618659229

Is it possible for the diet to have such visible effect already? Or is it something else? I’ve been careful to continue with my hair supplements with vit. D, b12, and so on.

PlantBasedDiet,How to talk to my friend and roommate about going plantbased?,"Hi everyone,

After watching a bunch of documentaries (What the health, among others) and generally feeling lethargic on my animal product rich lifestyle, plus reading about the animal product link to diabetes, heart disease and cancer, I figured it's time for a change. 

I bought the how not to die cookbook, swapped out my diary products with non diary for the transition, but here's the thing. 

Because of financial necessisity I currently live together with my friend who is a nurse and considers herself somewhat of an expert on nutrition. She thinks chicken, fish, eggs and dairy are healthy, etc. She also thinks there's nothing wrong with processed foods. She thinks instant puree is of the same quality as when made from scratch, etc. She is anti salt in home cooked meals but will eat chips and fries in the weekend no problem. She also hates fresh herbs and in general is super picky about food. You get the idea.  

She is also stubborn as a mule when someone disagrees with her. Like, we do great when we agree on stuff, but when we don't it's best to drop the subject alltogether because she won't budge no matter what facts you show her. 

So anyway, I really want to make the change. Problem is we alternate cooking for the both of us, and she has said she is not interested in going plantbased. 

I want to propose cooking our food seperately but since I have been doing the bulk of the shopping and cooking anyway over the past year I know that's not going to go over well. 

Basically I want some pointers on how to approach this conversation. My greatest weakness is that I am very sensitive to the judgments of friends and family and while I have made progress, I still find it hard to tackle stuff like this when it comes to big lifestyle changes.

Any tips?",1618578347
PlantBasedDiet,‘I wouldn’t eat that much fruit because of all the sugar’,"For a little bit of background I’ve been vegan for 6 years, I try and focus predominantly on whole foods but obviously still have junk/processed foods sometimes. 

I’ve recently been trying to be a little bit stricter and going back to ‘vegan basics’ - meaning just eating more whole foods and less things like cookies and crisps. 

A friend of mine replied to a post I put up earlier giving me a lecture on ‘how bad sugar is’ - the items that caused this response was a bowl that included some melon, grapes and an apple. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve had this sort of lecture over the years - a coworker once told me the amount of fruit/potato I consumed would cause me to be diabetic while simultaneously eating cooked ham out of packed. 

I’m just curious on other people’s thoughts related to this - regardless of sugar content I do ultimately believe you are much better to eat a variety of fruit and vegetables, and how you respond to these kind of comments. I try to not comment on other people’s diets but it seems with the rise of keto more and more people seem to want to come for me for eating an apple 🍎",1618577818

PlantBasedDiet,Spring Cleaning - what's is your vital Kitchen Equipment and what type of food do you cook and amount of people?,"Today I was spring cleaning my kitchen and wondered over the years how many purchases ended up good or not.  WFPB edition.

Let's see.  I make a lot of minimal starchy veggies like potato baked or ""pan fried"", rice in a saucepan on the stovetop along with salads.  I have no problem going fancy with vegan sushi and all that but that's not my daily cooking which is simple.  I make a lot of soups (tomato, butternut, etc) or stews like lentil stew, bean stews, etc.  Banana nicecream, sure.  When I'm entertaining, I sometime make pasta/sauces or crepes and other such comfort foods.  I don't do much baking involving flour products.

I typically cook for 1-4 people, sometimes more on invite about every other month.

(There are no referral codes, I just want to demonstrate what I have).

**Things I use**:

* Vitamix Blender - smooths soups, makes almond milk or cream, grinds my herbs, fruit smoothies if I wanted them, probably nut butters idk.  A really high speed blender is a game changer for certain things that are best smooth smooth.
* Immersion Blender - rougher results than vitamix but useful in mixing in pot while cooking or crushing ice, etc.
* Ceramic Knives - Chef Knife, Utility Knife.  I use black Kyocera Revolutions.  Ceramic knives are an excellent pairing with vegan cooking as long as you don't bend them - the only food that gave me problems of that sort are butternut squashes.  I used to have a lot of knives, I'm doing fine with a 7"" chef's knive and a small utility knife for processing garlic for 90% daily activity.
* Heavy steel cleaver.  Bashing garlic bulbs and cloves.  From my dad during my omni days.
* Steel Boning Knife and bread knife - when you need flexibility.  Bread with a crust is better with steel than ceramic.
* Small and large peeler - Small is ceramic to reduce browning, large is steel for flexibility for peeling things like butternut squash (ceramic is brittle).
* Induction Stovetop/Cooktop - I just like the speed and control they provide, they heat up and cool down fast.  Cheap countertop ones from Aldi and the like are trash but some online cooktops for around $100 are fine.  Unlike meat, I have very little use for high heat cooking oilless unless it's boiling water, so outlet wattage is fine.
* Mandolin - To make uniform and thin slices like cucumbers for salad or [WFPB potato chips](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ec1or9/5_minute_oilfree_potato_sweet_potato_tortilla_etc/).
* Mueller Onion Chopper - Coming from a family of chefs, I used to chop all my own veggies by hand, but in bigger batches, I find [anything in this style](https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Austria-Chopper-Vegetable-Container/dp/B08N9Q24M9) save time if you're making quantity or convenience like uniform slices of mushroom for a mushroom soup.
* Silicon Spatulas and Turners - I especially prefer the [single piece ones](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Heat-Resistant-Spatulas-Non-stick-Stainless/dp/B01N32WEAC) as there are no crevices for gunk to hide.
* Pots and pans - 3 nonstick small/medium/lg pan.  One stainless sauce pan.  Cast iron griddle for cooking tortillas.  Dutch oven for stews.
* 6qt Instant Pot - generic cooking, mostly soups and beans, fully or partially.
* Glass Storage containers.  Just hygienic and less worries about microplastics than plastic.
* Chest freezer.  Yup.  Time saver and energy saver.
* Silicon ice cube trays.  I got a fridge/freezer combo without ice dispenser as that feature alone double the fridge's power usage whether or not it's actively used.

Recent addition:
* KitchenAid KCO255BM - I replaced my $25 toaster over for this bigger ""Toaster Oven"" recently, but I love it.  Other than a large dutch oven preparation, I rarely turn on my full size oven on anymore, especially as it's getting warmer, this is just faster and less hassle.  Baked potatoes or anything else.  Timed and turns itself off.  Convection.  I never had an airfryer but I'm assuming with convection this does the same thing much more versatile.

**Things I personally didn't find of use** (doesn't mean it's bad, just not for me and my style of foods) and gave away in meantime:

* Food processor.  Idk, just never used it.
* Dehydrator.  Would love to if I had more herbs but I tend to consume all the ones I grow fresh LOL.
* Breadmaker.  Generally don't consume flour products, buying the odd bread is cheaper for me.
* Spiralizer.  I'm fine eating food in the shape they are in or knife chopped.  Not a big fan of alt pastas.
* Mixer / Stand mixer.  Used this in my baking days but generally stopped.
* Too many Knives - Set.  Even in my omni days, with knife sets used maybe 50% at most, 25% with any regularity.  Chef's knife is always a fine place to start and build up from there.
* Vacuum Sealer - I find gallon ziploc bags and glass storage containers just easier for the type of stuff I cook.  Can get out most air without a machine and freeze with stews in ziploc bag.  I'm not going to vacuum seal cooked pasta, potatos or rice, that stuff is cheap, stores well, and tastes better freshly made.
* Most single use Gadgets.  If a chef's knife can do it 80%, I most likely threw it out.  Or in my omni days, someone got me an egg seperator, even then I just used the egg shells to do the same thing without cleanup.  Or a silicon garlic peeler.  Or a sushi roller, lol.",1617914628

Yes my fat production and it’s 9 calories per gram were dramatically cut down but I also think I’m just one that doesn’t get satiated too fast on fat.  And I also crave it with its seasonings and salt to make it palatable. 

Quite simply, it’s very easy for me to overeat a fatty piece of meat and crave more hours later but to ask me to eat the same calories in fruit or starch is a real chore.  

Did our ancestors eat meat, yes.  Did they slather it with hot sauce and the best seasonings to make it taste better no.  

Have you ever ate a piece of chicken with nothing on it, not even salt?  It doesn’t taste very good.   You would probably eat half the amount that you are accustomed to eating.",1617841467

I'm following a plant-based meal plan and I get 1215.9 mcg of folate a day from food alone. From what I've researched, **it is impossible to get too much folate**, even though my Cronometer bar is red. **Would that conclusion be accurate?**

Secondly, I'm taking a multivitamin to meet my nutritional requirements within my caloric restriction, and that brings my folate level up to 1615.9 mcg with 240 mcg of folic acid. **Would this combination of folic acid with folate be harmful?**

Little bonus question as I create my plant-based meal plan for anyone who is willing to help: can anyone recommend low calorie, high choline plant-based foods? I'm really struggling to meet my 550 RDA even though I've crafted the plan around it.

PlantBasedDiet,Is there any way for “healthy fat” to achieve WFPB-like results?,"Hey guys. I’m trying to understand the underlying thesis behind WFPB and its low fat and “no oil” insistence. Basically, what would the science behind WFPB predict would happen to someone who had basically “normal” cholesterol (at least according to the mainstream) if instead of going WFPB they upped their fat intake to something like 40% but got it from EVOO, nuts, and fish. Assuming this person was out of the target ranges for WFPB initially, would there be any possible way for such a diet to achieve WFPB-like results in terms of numbers (sub 150 total, LDL less than 70)? Or would the additional fat, “healthy” or not, always raise cholesterol in such a case and thus promote atherosclerosis?",1617749293

&gt;""Despite 79% of health care professionals indicating plant-based diets can be an effective lifestyle modification for treating CKD, only 56% reported that they recommend the diets to their patients.""

They care more about the eating preferences of their inner circle, preference for meat and meal planning.

PlantBasedDiet,Struggling,"Hi all. Looking for a little encouragement here. Sorry in advance that this is so long! 

I have been on and off plant based for several years. I started on a really restrictive meal plan. I lost a lot of weight and felt good but it wasn’t sustainable. It required too much restriction and too little variety.  It also did a number on me mentally with the deprivation/over-indulgence/deprivation cycle. 

Since then I have tried to stay plant based but have been more middle of the road in terms of strictness. Meaning, I wouldn’t freak out if a baked good has an egg in it on occasion or a little bit of cheese here and there. Slowly over time, the “little bits” have become more and more to the point where I am full on eating cheese and some processed foods have come back into my diet. The minute I start thinking of “rules” or “restrictions” it triggers me and I end up eating “cheat foods”

I should also say I live in a house with non plant based eaters. My will power to resist some of their foods has dwindled too. I’m not eating meat at all, but too many “cheat” items have become a frequent occurrence. 

I really want to get back to feeling good and eating plant based, but I don’t want to go back to my original super strict diet either. 

I’m just feeling kind of down and defeated at this point. Having some doubts that I can actually do this diet consistently in a way that’s sustainable. Trying to find a way to get back on the horse and thought maybe some people here have had similar struggles? I love coming here to see all your awesome posts and amazing recipes. Any tips tricks or encouragement is soooo appreciated!

TLDR: Need help sticking to plant based guidelines without being overtly restrictive and triggering overeating.",1617632088

I talk about shilajit, skate liver oil, ashwagandha, cordyceps, lions mane, and a couple more. There's also a free metabolism booster/immune system strengthener Tea &amp; a PDF on ""Nature's Pharmacy"" in the description. Eye opening to see what medications deplete you of mineral/vitamins and which herbs and plants can help treat your medical issue + ADD minerals and vitamins (instead of depleting!!!)

PlantBasedDiet,Nutrition Tip: Add Quinoa Flakes to your curry and pasta sauces,"Lately I have been sprinkling small-medium quantities of quinoa flakes into dishes I've been cooking. It's an easy way to boost the nutrition profile of a meal without changing the taste or texture.

Quinoa flakes are processed in a similar way to old fashioned rolled oats which means they cook faster and are versatile (can also be used for something like quinoa porridge or quickly added to smoothies). If you are comfortable with this degree of processing I've found it to be a handy nutrition hack. Enjoy your quinoa!! 😊",1617509725

The freshly ground up flax had a sweetness and such an enhanced flavor profile compared to what I have been eating.
