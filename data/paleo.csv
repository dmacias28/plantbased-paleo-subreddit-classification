Paleo,Coconut/Cassava/Arrowroot flours in Shakes for more carbs? Which one?,"I am working out like crazy and need to up my carbs to stay afloat. I am on low-lectin diet while also severely limiting sugars/fruits, so I am basically down to sweet potatoes and yams as high carb sources. I was thinking of adding in some powdered carb sources to my daily smoothie. 

1/4 cup of Arrowroot Flour has 26g of carbs, zero sugar, zero protein, and zero fiber...

1/4 cup of Cassava Flour has 24g of carbs, 2g of sugar, zero protein, and zero fiber...

1/4 cup of Coconut Flour 16g of carbs, 4g of sugar, 4g of protein, and 12g of fiber... (4:3 Carb to Fiber Ratio)

Paleo,Almond milk and Coconut milk question,"Hi! I am genuinely befuddled and thought maybe you guys would have insight. And yes, I’m a total novice to Paleo, so maybe you’ll laugh at me. 

I bought both Almond milk and Coconut milk for the first time ever at the end of February. I was using them for smoothies, which my kids and I were enjoying for some weeks. It’s now May and these SAME 2 containers are still in my fridge— we never used all of the milks up. I was thinking of making a smoothie today. When I look online, obviously they say that these products are only supposed to last maybe 7 to 10 days after being opened. But they smell completely fine and also taste fine when I did a little taste test. We were still making smoothies well into March, so we were already using these products for weeks and weeks. 

Is it crazy that it’s now May and they still seem fine? Do almond milk and coconut last for months? Because these certainly seem fine but I’m assuming the average normal person would throw them away at this point. But as I said- they seem perfectly fine.

I really like veggies, but I have a hard time dealing with veggies for a myriad of reasons. I have a major tendency to waste food, especially veggies.  If I'm too tired to prep them (a symptom of a health condition), they often go to waste. They often have a mushy texture when cooked from frozen.  Even if I do prep them, I never seem to be able to cook them well. Baking and slow cooker are easiest, but I don't like them mushy.  Cooking on the stove takes too much effort, especially when you need a variety of veggies. I've decided I need to ""sneak"" them into my diet.

Paleo,"Rice/Oats replacement: while ""on those"", I was full and healthy. Now, I can stick to a paleo lifestyle 5-6 days a week, then I splurge on rice based meals. Suggestions/help?","As per topic. My diet hasn't changed much since I moved to a more paleo lifestyle. Except I don't feel as full, especially in the evening, and I struggle falling asleep.

I used to have 40-50g (raw) of oats for breakfast, with egg whites and blueberries -&gt; I replaced that with a chia+flax+proteinpowder+spinach+strawberries smoothie/shake (also for convenience and portability due to the a new job).

Lunch has always been a big arse salad with an omelette + a kiwi or 2 small satsumas

Pre gym, always a medium banana + almond butter, post a scoop of vegan protein powder with wather

Then dinner, which used to be chicken, brown rice and veggies -&gt; Rice replaced by swede/rutabaga or sweet potatoes.

All is good, Mon-Sat, then I just end up feeling like shit and eat (like it just happened) somethingI like 2-3 cups of cooked rice in one sitting. I still train hard and a lot (rock climber) for 5 days a week, 2-3hrs ish per day on average. I pack belly fat back as fast as I lose it.

Truth is, I also like the taste and texture of rice at dinner. And breakfast used to be 400-500 cals with oats, now when I checked it, it's more like 250-300 tops. It's filling, but I feel like my mind and body then team up and make me mindlessly catch up.

&amp;#x200B;

How did you do it? What did you replace rice with, for instance, in terms of satisfaction and satiety? I don't do well with high fat meats, am lactose intolerant and need to stay low fodmap to prevent the bloaty farts. Basically, eggs chicken salmon/tuna, occasionally mackerel or quorn mince (vegan mycoprotein based mince). Rutabaga is a savior, but doesn't fill me up as much as rice does, unless I pair it with 200g of spinach or kale :/",1650237535
Paleo,Bloodwork questions on Animal-Based diet,"I've transitioned from doing strict carnivore to including carbs like honey and potatoes which have improved my gym performance, sleep, libido, and electrolytes.

My diet is basically: lean ground beef, flank, pork loin, chicken breast, greek yogurt, potatoes, bone marrow, liver crisps, liver/organ supplements, tallow, butter. I'll include some veggies which I've found to agree with me and not make me bloated like onions, mushrooms, cucumber and zucchini. On the weekend I'll usually drink some wine with my meals. Lifting weights 5x a week, full-body workouts with compound movements. I stay active most of the day on my treadmill desk, I'm either walking or standing most of the day. 

This is my usual routine: I'll have a teaspoon of honey, Salt, and creatine before the gym at 6:30, a protein shake afterward followed by roughly 10 min of red light therapy; then lunch around noon (usually 250-300 grams of meat plus eggs and bone marrow and maybe a bit of veggies) and dinner at 18:00 - 19:00 (usually 250-300 grams of meat plus 250-300 grams of potatoes with tallow and greek yogurt). I'll take magnesium glycinate (400mg) at night before bed. Solid sleep usually with 3-4 hours of REM and Deep Sleep combined. I'll usually eat roughly 150-180g of protein (including the protein shake and other sources) per day. 

I recently did some blood work and most of my results are fine, but I have a few issues I would love to get people's thoughts on:

\- Total cholesterol is relatively high (265). I understand this metric on its own is irrelevant so I won't pay much attention to it by itself.  
\- HDL is ok (47) but I would like to increase it. How can I do that? I'm already exercising plenty, and have been eating animal fat for a while and minimizing seed oils.  
\- LDL is relatively high (212). Understanding that this metric in itself is not conclusive, it worries me in the context of having a normal, not high, HDL and relatively high Ferritin levels (next point)  
\- Ferritin is relatively high (328) and Serum Iron (58) is below the reference range. Am I taxing my system too much perhaps? What does this mean?  
\- Fasting insulin is pretty darn good (3.4), as well as C Reactive Protein (0.15), markers for metabolic health, low inflammation, and insulin sensitivity  
\- Total testosterone (1346) is through the roof (I do red light therapy on my balls in the morning when I'm doing my legs as well) but free testosterone (21.2) is normal. My understanding is this is a good thing, right? Can it be a problem? Total T is way above the range. I obviously don't take exogenous T or anything.  
\- Vitamin D is fine (62.4), I take 5k UIs daily, maybe I'll lower the dose. I get out to the sun when I can  
\- TSH T3 and T4 all within reference ranges  
\- Uric Acid, Creatinine, COQ10, etc.  within reference ranges as well

Appreciate any thoughts.

Paleo,Anyone else experienced SEVERE anxiety after eating processed food?,"I typically consume an adequate amount of fat and always feel terrific all the time. I also stay hydrated. My anxiety is non-existent.

Well, last night before bed I was craving something sweet so I had a big bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats and went to bed. (For those who don't know, cereals like those are sugar BOMBS. They are also HEAVILY processed. They contain canola oil on top it it all.) 
I also had a little chocolate mini muffin because my brother bought a box and I couldn't resist. 

I woke up the next morning feeling like I got hit my a bus. I didnt feel like my usual self. By the time I brushed my teeth and got ready for the gym, my anxiety was at a 7/10. I remember eating my usual scrambled eggs and noticing my hand shaking as I held my fork. I felt as if I wasn't even physically there. Brain fog and the whole nine. I was just taken aback knowing that I haven't experienced anything this severe in YEARS.
I felt like not only was my brain suffering but also my confidence. I wasn't feeling like my usual strong and social self. I just wanted to hide at home and close my blinds. 

EVERY single morning prior, I leave the house feeling great and ready to take on the day.
I'll start the day off with plenty of fats, eg - scrambled eggs cooked in butter with the occasional New York strip seared medium rare. I am GLOWING throughout the day and have laser-like focus. 

I KNOW I am not the only one who experiences this after I eat junk. 
Note: I feel fine after I eat it and can even function normally.....but the NEXT DAY is when it always gets me.

The only good thing that came out of that experience was that all that pent up energy gave me God-like strength in the gym. I was throwing those 120lb dumbells around like butter.",1649549853

Paleo,Epiphany Moment,"Context: I'm Female, 32 yo, 5'8"", pretty healthy/athletic, and am wanting to drop some excess fat.

Ok so... this is a long one, sorry, and doesn't really have anything to do with being Paleo although I'm mostly paleo now to not only lose the excess fat, but also because I really do believe it's the best way to eat generally, even if not 100% of the time. And I feel like in general, all of you fine folk are level headed and discussion oriented and will enjoy this for what it is, and maybe even take home a couple talking points for the next vegan you meet haha. 

Anyways, this was initially a reply to an OP in [r/StarchSolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarchSolution/) who was asking if they should try it or not, and also maybe it will help a lurker like me who has been reading about better ways of eating and watching so many ex-vegan youtube stories (that are now eating meat or paleo/carnivore), to find out why I was feeling horrible, losing hair, tired all the time, etc., and is why I will never again try to be a vegan.

So, again for anyone who is curious, or lurkers whether you're vegan or not and looking for anecdotes  or reasons to change your way of eating, I just wanted to share my honest results/opinions after a full month doing the vegan/plant-based Starch Solution protocol by Dr. McDougall last year for over a month, and actually just tried again for the past few weeks (I don't know why), but I literally just ended it today - and like I really tried I swear. I wanted it to work desperately - but I felt like utter garbage. 

Even though I know others have had success with it - a la the big influencers like High Carb Hannah, Plantiful Kiki, etc. - who I think are fine people just sharing what they believe works, and I have nothing against them - like I watched so many of their videos, got Hannah's books etc - But after it failed for me personally, and finally having a lot of epiphanies and red flags about so much of it, I’ve come to the conclusion that as simple and straightforward as it may seem - I don’t think it’s a diet/lifestyle/way of eating that any human being should do long term. Really for any length of time. 

I did it the way as described by McDougall, Hannah, kiki... I read the book, read the China study, watched SO MANY YouTube lectures by Dr McDougall, and others like Neil Barnard, forks over knives, Game Changers, etc etc  - and I was so pulled in by it all thinking ""Yeah this sounds great, this makes so much sense, this is definitely the best way to eat..."" - FULLY SOLD ON IT. So when I finally started, I was so excited that first week because of the “jumpstart in weight loss” - which is why I started it FYI, for weight loss, but of course thought this is the way to amazing overall health too not just weight loss blah blah blah... But I come from a past of yoyo diets, binge/restrict eating and CICO failures (because it doesn’t work - a calorie is not a calorie - I firmly believe that now and sure it may work short term but it totally fucks your metabolism, excuse my language, but that’s a whole different rant lol).

Anyways, after all that and then finding the ""whole food plant-based"" protocol, I was like ""Oooo maybe this is it!! I'll finally get fit and healthy!""... So yeah, I did it DILIGENTLY, and just in two weeks - again my judgement was clouded by the initial number drop on the scale which I now know is because I was just eating so few calories and crunchy water (aka lettuce) - but after only two weeks, I was like oh god this is TERRIBLE.... I feel terrible, I look terrible, I can’t fucking sleep, I’m cold, my hair and skin look and feel horrible, and I’m not even hungry anymore because I feel nauseous all the time, especially when I try to eat this bland ass horrible food with no fats to help with the uptake and digestion of the nutrients these supposedly nutritious foods hold, so what even is the point...?? And these were foods I initially LOVED eating. Some of my favorites: potatoes, broccoli, carrots, green beans... it just SUCKED.

And like all due respect to Dr. McDougall, who I'm sure is just preaching what he really believes, but I REwatched his conference/medical talks that are on YouTube several times, trying to pump myself up again and get motivated and stick to it, because I MUST be doing something wrong, right??... And I just wanted more knowledge in general about the entire wfpb way of eating, especially because I’m the type that likes going to the source material and reading the studies myself vs just relying on ""experts/doctors"" and other people who’ve had success (though I do like watching people like high carb Hannah and plantiful Kiki, you know, for personal results and anecdotes and how they accomplished everything - still do, but just with paleo people and ex-vegans lol), but afterwards I still want to read the facts myself to make up my own mind and see if there are any gaps no one is telling me.

So back to the Dr. McDougall talk on youtube: [https://youtu.be/8HgU6W6aD5M](https://youtu.be/8HgU6W6aD5M) \- skip to the 50 minute mark - and for context, when he mentions ""Einstein"", he means his cat. And if you want to watch the whole thing like I did go ahead haha - But again, I had watched this talk before, maybe even twice, and am watching it AGAIN because I think I'm doing it wrong - and again I was like yeah yeah yeah, soaking it up, agreeing with everything because he’s a doctor right... but then I was watching him present everything starting at the 50 minute mark on and something deep in my brain and body was like WAIT... and suddenly so many red flags and A LOT of epiphanies hit me about just EVERYTHING diet/fitness/health related, but especially about how flawed the Starch Solution is and really all vegan diets.

At that 50 minute mark, he shows a photo of a raw steak and then raw poultry and fish, and how it’s unappetizing, right? Of course, and he says “it’s not our food"". And then he goes on to show pictures of comforting plant-based meals and talks about how we find these photos appetizing of all these starch/vegan foods and dishes because these are “our food”, right? And my brain went STOP..... it took me 3x to watch it... but STAWP. That is so WRONG. The red flag: he showed a picture of UNCOOKED RAW meat and then a lot of pictures of not only COOKED starches and veggies, but LEGIT FULL MEALS of cooked and seasoned put together, beautifully plated meals of starches and veggies: roasted potatoes, soups/stews, pasta with sauce on it, etc.

And my brain went Umm... wait a second. That’s so misleading!! You can’t show a photo of RAW UNCOOKED meat, followed by COOKED potatoes and rice and beans and pasta, because you WOULD NEVER EAT UNCOOKED potatoes, UNCOOKED pasta, UNCOOKED beans or rice... that’s ludicrous!! So then my main epiphany: before this point he was talking about ALL the countries and people groups who have “lived on starches” and again my brain went NOPE. Because yes, they might have eaten a lot of starches, vegetables and fruits, and maybe even the majority of their food were those, not because they ONLY ate those things and were vegan, but because those foods were in abundance and cheap and most people weren’t kings who could afford meat all the time, etc. But ALL of those people still ate quite a bit of seafood if they were on the coast or islands, and/or pork, beef and eggs if inland, not to mention hunted, etc... so the majority might have eaten a lot starches, because again not all were kings, just like all the bread and potatoes in European middle age times, but none of them were ever JUST starch/plant-based vegan like the China Study, McDougall, and many other vegan doctors like to proselytize.

Anyways, McDougall goes on to talk about how recently, over the last few decades, after these people groups (Hawaiians, Chinese, etc all his examples) have abandoned their historic starch based lifestyles like their ancestors ate, now they're fat and unhealthy and diseased” and another epiphany was... well yeah, it’s called fast food and processed junk that we ALL transitioned to and were raised on via 80s/90s advertising and the lack of all of us being farmers, or having 50's moms to make food for us from scratch every damn day, and having industrialized literally everything about life...

And my brain went, so... it’s not the meat/animal products making us sick, or the saturated fats making us fat (which I now know in fact we need for hormone production, especially as women, but just as humans in general - just not the shitty seed oils) - but it’s just all the unhealthy junk foods and processed foods and crazy chemicals (Duh Duh and Duh) and all the ingredients and weirdly lined packaging/cans (which has kind of gotten better-ish) - but what if it’s all that stuff AND NOT the meat or fats? And of course, the well-sourced, well-fed locally-grown whatever is better than the industrially raised version, but again not all of us our kings and can afford $15 avocados at the farmers market haha. But yeah, all of a sudden I was like Woooah.... that was so misleading and kind of unfair to compare raw meat to cooked foods that many people gravitate towards and find emotionally and aesthetically pleasing such as pasta.

So yeah, after all the red flags and epiphanies I immediately stopped watching it, went to the store to buy some chicken and olive oil, made dinner and legit after just ONE Non-vegan/Starch Solution meal I felt 10x better and I actually slept more than 4 hours that night. What a concept. Lol

So that's my main thing, and again if anyone wants to talk more about it, let me know and I’d be happy too because again, I recently tried being vegan again and FAILEd again (no shit sherlock) and have done so many deep dives into medical studies and research on all of it. Because I don’t just want to say “it's terrible, don't do it” and not giving you any reasons why, because I hate when people do that in their posts/comments haha. But tbh, after that moment everything made so much sense to me and I thought back to when I was paleo for a while, the only thing that ever worked for me to lose fat, that I was able to stick to for quite some time, AND made me feel amazing. So I’ve gone back to being 80% paleo - not low-carb/keto paleo, just regular paleo - I eat plenty of potatoes and fruits because they're healthy and delicious, along with some dairy, rice and beans.

Some bonus thoughts I've had recently on my deep dives into not being Vegan anymore:

1. Every vegan youtuber and doctor talks about supplementing with B12 (only found in animal sources) and Iron (animals) and even a few things I never thought of (Iodine, Selenium, Vitamin K...) mostly in response to hair loss and skin and nail health, etc. And I'm like, if a way of eating/lifestyle FORCES you to take extra vitamins because it's not part of the diet... then it's probably not a good way to live. I also realized, something a lot of people skip over when detailing how biochemical processes work in the body - is how certain nutrients from specific sources influence hormones, which is needed to create this other hormone/substance inside your body, which then in turn affects/starts this very important process in your body... so no wonder as a vegan (for example) your hair is falling out, because you're not getting the CORRECT type of omega-3 from FISH, or Iodine and B12 from animals sources, that in turn help to CREATE specific hormones in your body that helps processes keep going - i.e. what helps your hair follicle stay healthy, coated, and attached to your scalp. So if you're deficient in just one of these vitamins, or are using a plant source of it, you could be wrecking that whole process inside your body.
2. Another thing I recently compared was just how healthy people LOOKED - vegans vs non-vegans. And I know everyone has different genes, but like... if you're truly getting a well-balanced diet (which kinda goes with bonus thought #1 - your body is going to last longer, you're going to look healthier, and maybe even younger. So, I compared how Dr. McDougall looked in that Youtube video linked above, which is from 2019, to a 2019 photo of Mark Sisson, who is a primal/paleo guy. And holy crap... the difference was staggering. And yes Dr. McDougall is older, but only by a few years. And if you compare the aging between them from 2019 to now in 2022, just a few years, it's also crazy how much older and frail McDougall looks compared to Mark.
3. Of course vegan/wfpb diets are going to work so well for so many people when transition from a typical SAD diet, or even a semi-balanced one if they're eating a bit too much junk and not admitting it to themselves, NOT because it's the ""prefect/best"" diet for humans, but because you go from eating a lot to almost eating nothing - i.e. crunchy water. And generally, if you just up your vegetable intake, you'll probably see good results even if you change nothing else, so i can see why all of a sudden people are like OMG wfpb raw vegan eating is the way and copy Freelee the banana girl... no, you just ate an apple for the first time in 3 years and your cells are rejoicing. Don't conflate one refreshing change that makes you feel better in the moment as the end all be all of diets. 

Anyways... I hope this was at least somewhat interesting/amusing, and not just taken as the ramblings of a madwoman lol :)",1648527083

Paleo,Am i doing this right?," 

Hello, I Just wanted to get some feedback, please.

Right now im eating the same thing everyday.

2 meals per day.

First meal: 2 steaks.  1 banana.

Second meal: 3 cups of 80/20 ground beef with salt n pepper, and 1/4 cup of beef tallow added for extra fat.  1 cup of Berries.

I   did some calculations and i'm roughly estimating to be getting around 1   gram of fat and 1 gram of protein per pound that i weigh right now.    Again, roughly.

I also supplement with vitamins, and electrolyte tablets.

This is what i consume every single day.  Nothing else.

So am i doing this right?

Is   this healthy?  I don't eat chicken or fish.  It's just doesn't satisfy   me the same way red meat does.  So i'm eating red meat twice a day,   everyday.

I've been doing this for   about 2 weeks and i feel fantastic.  I feel 10 years younger.  Brain   fog gone.  Down 5 pounds already.  More energy etc. etc.

So is this healthy?  Is it okay to continue on this way?  Am i at risk for any deficiencies?  Any suggestions?

Is   anybody else putting beef tallow on their ground beef?  Or am i crazy?    Also is it safe to eat just a spoonful of room temperature beef  tallow  if i want a quick fat boost?

I just wanna know i'm on the right track, friends haha.

Paleo,"I have a theory that caffeine is masking a lot of the detrimental effects of processed flour, refined sugars, etc.","
I used to drink coffee. A lot. Yet, about 5 years ago I got very lean. What did I do? I cut out processed sugars. However, I ate a lot of bread. Hell, most of my diet was cheeseburgers and bread etc.

And lots of coffee.

The caveat? I wasn't allowed to eat sugary stuff. I got pretty lean. 

Approximately 4 years later, I let the sugar creep back into my life. I had quit my caffeine habit. And had been caffeine free for 3 years. ""All I need to do is just quit sugar"" - I told myself.

It worked horrendously. Even keeping my diet normal, eating the bread I wanted. And the carbs I wanted. I still could not lose the weight. What was I doing different? The only difference is I did not have caffeine in my diet anymore, to mask the inadequacies I was getting in my nutrition.

Stimulants are an excellent way to help you lose weight. Just take a look at any meth addict and.. well.. (not too disparage addicts here.)

Having tried paleo for a week, I noticed my brain fog literally just vanished. I felt a bit lighter on my feet. I experimented with eating a small bowl of oatmeal and again, the brain fog returned. I ate a slice of toast. The brain fog returned.

But paleo is hard, I think to myself. Sometimes my body starts for that full feeling. I had run out of paleo food and in a slight moment of weakness, a few slices of pizza and a small chocolate cookie. Eating paleo is actually very easy for me. Being consistent in eating paleo is easy for me because I enjoy all of these foods.

 It's just that, I hadn't made a trip to the store and the family bought a pizza and I was exhausted for the day.

30 minutes after I ate all these carbs, my stomach felt super heavy. My body felt like a blimp. I then had to run to the bathroom in an emergency case of the shits. Then I started sneezing. My mood got a little irritated. My allergies got a little inflamed. Wow. Have I become a food sensitive wuss? Or is my body telling me something. Why are processed sugars and flours having such a huge effect on me?

There's a bodybuilder on youtube. He is ripped. Surely he knew the answers to nutrition. Calories in, calories out. This is a fact, and anyone who follows a plan like this surely will get ripped.

He went into the specifics of his diet. Lots of lean chicken..and..... FRUITY LOOPS cereal..?? No. He's just joking around. That can't be his diet. What's this? A pop-tart? Two pop-tarts, a bowl of fruity loops, and chicken breast?

How is he able to stay lean yet eat all these processed refined sugars? Then I remembered. Caffeine. Stimulants have a powerful way of masking the effects on our glycemic response. Duh. I tried it myself. I had a sugary snack thinking I can still get lean and my energy tanked.

Then I remembered. The YouTube bodybuilder was sucking on coffee prior to making the video. In fact, he distinctly talks about having his coffee in the first thing in the morning, just like I used to. But I cannot rely on that stimulant no longer. I have to rely on the natural clean energy my body can provide for me without stimulation.

And it seems, the only way my body will let me do this.. strangely, is eating the most less processed foods available. It seems the more refined and process the carbohydrate is, the more taxing it is on my mental acuity.

I wish I could carb load and live a normal life like everyone. I wish I could sip on coffee with a Pop-Tart and run out the door and be fine for 5 hours like I used to. But I always valued not having to rely on a drug for energy. And all these experiments have brought me to this point. To seek purity in my diet and lifestyle for the most optimum nutrition.

And in doing so, one learns their response to various foods. Fruit, nuts, lean meats, these tend not to have much of an effect on my energy and blood sugar response. Given, sure, too much of a particular fruit can cause a high spike in blood sugar and a subsequent, crash depending on the time of day. 

So I think it is important to pay special attention to sugar intake in regards to fructose. But the nutrients that come with fruit are uncomparable to that which comes from refined sugars.

I did paleo a year ago for 3 months. I lost weight and pretty much had the exact perfect body I wanted. Still chubby but more ""thicc"" and curvy but my stomach was flatter and had less rolls. I loved it. I was so happy. Then slowly started gaining the weight back when I started eating the foods I missed eating. Now a year later I am fat again. I don't weigh myself (I haven't for years for my mental health) because if I did that it would make me go insane and cry all day so I can't give you an exact number of how much I lost and gained. 

Doing paleo last year was a straight, linear progressive line of consisently losing fat weekly. My belly would get flatter and flatter. This time around I seem to be actually gaining weight and getting fatter despite the fact that I am sticking to the exact diet I did before and have been doing it for two weeks. I am doing things exactly as I did before and it looks like I am rapidly gaining weight and I my bloating is out of control. Really upsetting. 

I also deal with vaginal pain and vaginal ph/chronic yeast infection issues and I know that's most definitely playing a part in the bloating and other complications. I am taking vaginal probiotics like that I actually put up there and they worked wonders in the past. They are doing fuck all this time around. 

Am I maybe not eating enough and going into starvation mode by accident? I really dont think so. My meals are normal sized and I have peanuts as a snack and I eat celery as my nighttime snack an hour or two before bed. I am doing what I did the first time and seem to be getting opposite results. Just wondering if anyone on here has experienced anything similar or has any input. Of course if you're a man and want to respond that's totally fine but would appreciate another woman's perspective.",1647638475

Paleo,[BEST DIET?] What Should I Change for a 10/10,"Hey. I am 21M fit/athletic. I don't care about how I look but actually being healthy. I am looking for advice on how I can improve my diet. My goal isn't to lose weight or gain weight but be healthy. I am looking for advice on some essential vitamins/minerals I might be missing.

What I eat daily:

1st meal:

* 200g oats
* 200ml milk
* 3g cocoa
* 10g chia or flaxseeds
* 20g berries (blue, black, strawberry)
* 2bananas or 1 big apple (200g)

during the day I eat (snacks)

* nuts (walnuts, hazelnut, or pecan) (10-50)
* fruits (4-5 fruits, mostly bananas or apples) every day,
* and some sardines if I need some protein (this is not every day, maybe once a week)

2nd meal would be

* rice with lentils (green or red) or rice with beans
* meat (eggs, chicken, fish, meat), (about 200-300g)
* veggie mix (potatoes, carrots, green peas) or broccoli or spinach (alternate)

I use cayenne pepper, cumin, salt, pepper, and ginger every day and cook with olive oil.

This is literary what I eat. I don't have any sauces or ever eat anything else. I am a student and trying to cook as efficiently as possible. Don't even use onions even tho I should

I am looking for some advice on what I can add to improve my diet overall.

Please don't mention me consuming 6-8 portions of fruit per day :D",1647545892

Paleo,does caffeine cover up the toxicity of most starches and carbs?,"
By toxicity I mean, the possible insulin triggering response most processed carbohydrates have in today's society? For example it's pretty common to have a bagel, muffin, cereal, oatmeal, with your coffee.

Yet, do we as a society not see that possibly the caffeine is masking the high insulin response of many of these types of foods?

I myself cut out sugar and drink lots of coffee many years ago and I got very lean. But I also ate all kinds of breads and toast and buns. 

It wasn't until I cut out caffeine did I realize how high of a insulin response it triggers which sometimes, if not often made me feel lethargic. On top of that, losing weight is impossible with these types of foods in my diet.",1647386335
Paleo,Oatmeal is literally making me drunk. (37 m),"Friday morning, I had my routine bowl of oatmeal and literally felt drunk right after. My mind was foggy. I couldn't think. Feels like something is draining my brain power. Right then and there, I went Paleo. 

During Paleo, my diet has been consisting of meats, some fatty meat, and fruits. I noticed I didn't get that ""Drunk long lasting brain fog"" I get on oatmeal, so that is a good sign. However, since my body is adjusting, I did have a few instances in paleo where I have ""Crashed""

I think it was after a big meal of grapes. The other instance is when, my body was adjusting to lack of carbs. I ""Crashed"" so to speak.

I wondered if Paleo was maybe the wrong way to go about things, because I found to be a little backed up in the digestion. And I am experimenting with new eating styles. So this morning, I figured I would see what would happen if I ate a small bowl of oatmeal.

First thing I noticed, is that I literally have this annoying, terrible brain fog that will not go away. I remember this, 4 days ago when I last had my bowl of oatmeal. I always attributed this to ""Cutting calories"" and was part of the weight loss process, but now I am for certain that I am completely insulin sensitive to oats.

But it's not just oats, it definitely has to be the same for other complex carbs. My only qualm is, I am bit on the fence about eating a lot of fruit. So I am looking to pair my meals with a healthy mix of lean meat, fats, and perhaps, as Goggins does, a 20% in Avocado.

I actually have been enjoying Paleo, and I noticed that mental fog had been disspiating. My only qualm about PAleo is the effect it's been having on my muscular endurance. It seems I am lacking in the endurance. Does this go away? Do the muscles re-adjust?

I cannot believe how brain fogged I currently am at the moment with that bowl of oatmeal. I used to be able to mask this with caffeine, but since I do not take caffeine anymore, I cannot believe how much this oatmeal has spiked my insulin.",1647377845

I've been taking a Reserverage brand Resveratrol supplement for the past month. It was 250 mgs of Resveratrol. Listed under ""other ingredients"" is ""rice bran"", which I know is bad but figured it's such a small amount, hey, can't hurt. Since really being committed to pure paleo for the last 10 days, I'm beginning to feel that purity and ""switch"" you all know.

Today I ran out of the resveratrol, so bought some more. However, *this* bottle is only 100 mgs of resveratrol, but in the same size capsule (cheaper, saving up for TA-65). My concern is this- if the amount of resveratrol is less than half, but the capsule is roughly the same size, dos this mean there is more rice bran as ""filler?""

Paleo,Thinking of starting paleo - worried about losing weight?,"Hi all,

I'm mid 30's, what most would consider ""fit and healthy"" in that I excercise regularly, ran half marathons, done an ironman, lift weights and do cardio several times a week.

However, I have high blood pressure, mostly pre-hypertension levels but its creeped into stage 1 hyper in the past few weeks.

I'm 6ft and around 90kg (around 200lbs for my american brothers and sisters). I rarely drink, have recently cut out caffeine and don't smoke.

I always thought my diet was ""healthy"" because I rarely eat junk, but I eat a LOT of grains. 3 to 4 scoops of oats in my protein shakes, bread, potatoes etc.

I've been reading up on paleo and how it might help my BP. My main worry though is being able to get enough calories in per day. I have always been slim and putting weight on for me has been difficult. I'm at my ideal weight now and want to keep it that way.

Obviously I don't want to be consuming tons of nuts every day, and the paleo food list looks a little limited. Can anybody offer some advice recommendations for being able to consume around 3,000 calories a day with Paleo?

Paleo,"Grain free questions about ingredients, rice protein powder","Asking here because the grain-free sub is very inactive.

I have been eating grain free for about 9 months. It has helped me a lot with my skin and allergy issues. I have had some allowances here and there, like over the holidays, or if something has 1 ingredient I may go for it if it's something I had already in my pantry or a friend made me a breakfast smoothie. Over the holidays my skin freaked out so I know I won't go back to doing grains in general.  


Question about protein supplements or other items that contain rice protein.  A lot of things have rice protein as an ingredient. How much of the negative qualities of rice are actually in the product? I'm sure it's different for each thing but some protein powders or some things like crackers might have rice protein in them. I don't eat grains but am I just screwing it all up if I drink a protein shake every morning with this ingredient? I generally avoid most milk products so I do not use whey protein. I do sometimes use collagen powder. I have vegetarian or vegan protein powders mostly.

And similarly, a question about alcoholic drinks made from rice (or other grains). How much of the antinutrient is still in the drink, sake, beer, or liquor made from grains?

I’m a graduate student with the usual time and money limitations associated with grad school, as well as some mobility issues.

For the past month and a half, I was (and still am) on a very strict paleo/primal diet (only red meat with small amounts of pork/chicken here and there(all from a great butcher), free range eggs and sometimes sardines, and alot of fruit (apples,oranges,kiwi and rarely pineapple or other fruits) + vitamin d capsule right after eating meat. Also, 70-80% of time i eat once a day (OMAD) and my estimate is that I eat about 150g protein per day. My question is why am I, while on this strict diet and heavy training in a gym 7 days a week, not losing any fat? I did get a solid amount of muscle but I still have that stubborn belly fat I had while eating horribly. Any advices?",1645563666

Paleo,Rabbit organ meat,"I know beef organs are all the rage among paleo, carnivore and similar diets, but I want to know about other organ meats.

I can find beef, lamb, pork and chicken liver locally (haven't tried yet, will soon), but that's it.

I looked at Ancestral Supplements and their wide range of organ supplements - however, some doubt if they're actually worth the price, especially liver, since it's easy to just buy and eat.

But they sell many other organs, like ovaries, heart, brain, and various glands, and I was intrigued. Still, there's the price. I am planning on getting a homestead in the future, but where I am now, I could only raise rabbits and some minor birds (quail, pigeon).

Since the only way for me to get access to every organ is raising it myself (or buying those supplements), rabbit is the top candidate. Can anyone give me info on rabbit organ meats? I searched but couldn't find anything. Also info on poultry organ meat would be interesting.

Thank you.

TL;DR: I want to raise rabbits at home and wonder about the nutrition of their organ meats.",1645386411
Paleo,What is your experiences with different carb range ?,"0-50 : keto , I got fat adapted , I have energy and mental clarity but my libido are lower

50-150: Hell, deep depression, deep feeling of despair, no inflammation though, energy is low. but I gotta say I was on 700 calories deficit. so that could be a reason, when a body enter a state of deprivation it def gotta be not in a healthy place. 

150-250: Best in terms of satiety and energy but inflamed a little bit. normal diet. I dont feel any benefits

250-350: the more I eat huge amounts of carbs the more part of of my day wasted being fatigue, bloated, this happens slightly with 250g carbs and significantly with 350. heavy carbs meal made me lazy and unproductive the next 2 hours unless I walk a lot to boost digestion

Paleo,Not new to Paleo but it's been awhile....,"I've eaten the Paleo diet in the past but usually in the end got lazy (mostly because of whiskey. lol) and ended up going back to a ""normal"" diet over time. This time (it's been since January 1) I'm determined to keep it. I have ALWAYS felt better eating Paleo - always. And there are so many products out there - mostly from Primal kitchen, but there are others, that are specifically designed with this lifestyle choice in mind. I don't call it a diet because to me that is a bad connotation. It IS a lifestyle choice, for sure.

I also quit drinking on the 1st (believe me, no easy task). Got back into a regular workout routine and since then have dropped 20+ pounds (about 10 to go) and feel better than I have in years. 

I think turning 60 last year had something to do with my decisions here. The number alone scares the crap out of me. I've heard that after 60 things can go downhill REAL fast if you don't take care of yourself - work your body and your mind and eat right, etc...

I'm here for good.... I know my lifestyle and food choices NOW are going to make all the difference for me for the rest of my life, which I hope is considerably longer. :-)

I am also about a month or so away from starting P90X again (haven't done that in several years either) but I'm working my way up to it. Go Paleo and eat healthy my friends!",1644960456

As a creature of habit, I have had a kale salad complete with tomatoes, peppers, onion, cucumber for dinner going back almost three years now. 

Like a lot of people who don't initially love kale, I found it too bitter or plain. But the thing that got me hooked was finding a salad dressing that complimented everything in the bowl wit ha sweet touch and low to no sugar.

First it was [Bolthouse Farms Organic Raspberry Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing](https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/bolthouse-farms-organic-raspberry-balsamic-vinaigrette-dressing/0007146401947).

But then I found the [Cleveland Kraut Sweet Beet Dressing](https://www.clevelandkitchen.com/products/sweet-beet). Same nutrition positives, a big bottle that lasted me a week, very clean ingredients, available at Target and Whole Foods...

Paleo,Primal Weightloss Diet,"Aajonus Vonderplanitz, nutritionist of the Primal Diet has a few protocols that he gives his clients for weight loss. One protocol, which can be applied raw or cooked, I will explain here.

He has his clients drink vegetable juice, and raw eggs. Thats it. Until you lose the weight. The vegetable juice had electrolytes, and will keep your digestion functioning well. The eggs, containing every nutrient in existence, are the easiest to digest food. They fully digest in about 30 minutes. The protein contains all the amino acids, and combined with good raw animal fat, the eggs provide great focus and energy. This also gives the intestines a great break because the egg completely digests at the very beginning of the intestines. 

But, I mean, you could eat hard boiled eggs and drink cucumber juice. You won’t get the benefit of giving the intestines a break. You’ll feel more shitty. Less energy. But you could do it. If you are scared of salmonella or something. 

I’ve never gotten sick off a raw egg. I’ve never met someone in real life who has gotten sick off of a raw egg. Good quality raw eggs though! Straight from the farm, or at least pasture raised. And don’t refrigerate it! You want the bacteria! It helps digestion! Or cook it. Don’t ban me. 

So for making the cucumber juice, a masticating juicer is best. If it is centrifugal, air will stir inside it and damage a lot of the nutrients. Better than no juice though. But you need to make it yourself, with organic cucumbers, and peel them! Very important to peel them. A lot have petroleum wax on them that is toxic. You could dice it, then blend it, then squeeze it through a strainer. You'll probably drink 1-3 cups a day. But a masticating juicer is best. You’ll get a better yield, and a higher quality juice.

Why juice? The fiber overly alkalizes the digestive tract, which prevents the digestion of the raw protein in the egg. It is very hydrating, and you’ll be more hydrated, with less liquids overall.

If you want to drink water, drink naturally carbonated sparkling water. Pellegrino is a brand I trust. Not sponsored. With carbonated water, the carbonation kills any bacteria, so it passes inspections to be sold with no chemicals . Other brands need some chemicals to deem it safe to pass inspection. Naturally carbonated mineral water is the best.

You could squeeze lemon or lime into the water for electrolytes for better hydration. 

Adding raw honey is great. Many brands that say raw, are heated often up to 160, degrees. It has to never go above 93. A majority of the time I get straight from the farmer, it is also heated. How you can tell is, eat it by itself, and if it burns your throat, it has been heated too hot at some point. The only 2 brands of honey I trust are called Really Raw which is in many health food stores, and Y.S. ORGANIC BEE FARMS. USDA ORGANIC 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY from Whole Foods in north west Arkansas.. Be really careful with your honey choice. Often, you need to take a picture of all the info of the honey at the store, and go home and email and call all of them and ask about the temperatures, heating, and storing during transportation, etc.

But honey is great. Don’t over do it though. Like 2 tablespoons per 4 ounces of water, with 4 ounces of lime or lemon juice. That is a good sports drink. You could even get raw cream, and crack a raw egg in it. The raw cream will prevent the egg from oxidizing, and provide raw fat, and the egg will give easily digested protein, for focus during whatever you are doing.

I could go into a lot more detail. I think it would have to be for other posts.

In the end:
1-3 cups of vegetable juice
.5-3 cups of mineral water with lemon/lime + honey.
12-60+ up to infinite raw eggs. You can eat as many raw eggs as you want.

Cucumbers must be organic and peeled.

Lemons/limes organic. Hand squeezed, strain seeds

Section for water from We Want to Live, Page 180 
“CARBONATED BEVERAGES AND WATERS: If a label reads “carbonation added” or “carbonated” it means that the carbonation is synthetic. Synthetic carbonation causes radicals and free radicals, resulting in mineral and oxygen deficiencies, sometimes resulting in headaches. If a label reads “naturally carbonated”, or “natural carbonation added” or “naturally sparkling”, the carbonation is natural from the well and highly charged with healthful electrolytes. See page 72.
In combination with unheated honey, naturally carbonated waters relieve most headaches. Naturally carbonated waters help relax adrenal glands. Therefore, if you are an individual with low energy, it would probably be better to drink naturally sparkling water only when needed in a remedy.”
So if you have low energy, don’t drink the carbonation. Just shake the carbonation out.
 
So with the eggs, you can eat as many as you want. If you ever get nauseous, that might be because your body is burning fat that has toxins in it and the toxins are being sent to the stomach to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid. Don’t blame the eggs. Or the chickens are fed toxic feed with stuff like gmo corn, or soy. Chickens are scavengers, aka meat eaterns. A vegetarian diet is the worst diet a chicken could have. Make sure it is at least pasture raised. If an egg made you nauseous, maybe the egg is low quality. To combat that, if you eat the egg with a small bit of raw, unheated, unsalted cheese, the cheese will absorb anything toxic in the egg and prevent any damage. The egg is not the problem. Its the toxic feed, hormones, anything like that, that is given to the chickens. If the chicken is healthy, outside, no medicine, on healthy soil, fed no supplements, just extra bugs, or meat/organ scraps of other butchered animals on the farm. Or kill the predators and feed them to the chickens. That will make them healthy. No medicine. Just food, healthy soil, sunshine, healthy air.

Cheese also absorbs toxins that create nausea. Sometimes your body will break down toxins stored somewhere, and your body decides to send it to the stomach, to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid to become less toxic, or if its severe, you will vomit those toxins out. Vomit is the strongest form of detox. The bacteria isn’t the problem. It will break down the toxins that are stored in the body from a lofe time of cooked food, and industrial toxins, from all sorts of things.

Whenever you need focus, just eat an egg. In about 15 minutes, you’ll start to get more energy.

This information is not a guideline to follow ir, it is just an example of what some of it would maybe look like. If you want to do it, don’t base it off of this information. Study Aajonus yourself, and do it right. Any problems that people have are always due to lack of understanding, or lack of access to the right foods. There is hundreds of hours of detailed information. There is a lot of condensed information also. But read both of his books. We Want to Live and The Recipe to Living Without Disease, in order to understand how to do it properly. Then you can get the details quoted from Aajonus himself from the help of a telegram group or another subreddit. There is a lot of information. But there are easy simple ways to start.

I would expect 1 lb lost a day, maybe up to 3, depends. If you feel too bad, or detox too hard, you need to eat the raw unsalted cheese, butter, more eggs, cut back on the vegetable juice and water, sip up to a gallon of milk a day

It is very important that you sip all liquids! If you don’t sip, you will piss out most of the nutrients. Your stomach breaks down your food, so that your intestines can digest it. If you chug anything, your intestines cant digest a lot of liquid at one time, because if it tried to, it would turn into a bunch of diarrhea. So a good rule of thumb that Aajonus recommends is about 1 oz per minute max. Or else you’ll piss it out and waste nutrients. 

Everything is better in glass. Anything that ferments in plastic will become toxic. The fermentation is a result of bacteria pre digesting the food. When it ferments in plastic, the bacteria also predigest the plastic, then the food becomes toxic. If its fresh in plastic, usually fine. Plastic wrap has a toxic chemical in it. Even when its in meat packaging. Meat touching paper is also bad. It won’t kill you though. Don’t let it sit for long! Transfer to glass. Same with milk. Transfer milk to glass. Cheese, butter, cream, honey, etc. 

Plastic is ok if its fresh and not too hot or cold. And doesn’t sit for very long. Won’t kill you if you break some of these rules. Some are more dangerous than others.

Can be done safe! The problems isn’t the food. Its the additives, packaging, heating, freezing. Keep your eggs room temperature!

Study Aajonus and base it all of him! Everything I said is based off of Aajonus. 

So how does the weight loss work? If you only eat eggs, you lose a lot of weight. That's what Aajonus says. It is true. Only eat eggs, you’ll lose a bunch of weight. And you drink the cucumber/celery juice when your thirsty, it will also keep your appetite high to eat more eggs. Aajonus recommends to eat a golfball size piece of raw beef whenever you are very hungry, but not angry-hungry. You can just do eggs though. If you aren’t into that, do the same thing , but with hard boiled eggs. But you’ll have more problems If you use pasteurized juice, you’ll have more problems. If you do fruit juice, even if raw, you’ll have more problems and be very emotional.

You really need to study a lot. The diet isn’t what's dangerous . This is just reality. He didn’t make food this way. It’s just how it is. You just have to change your understanding. To people who study diligently, it's all natural.

Paleo,Intermittent fasting and autophagy,"What is autophagy?

Humanity has longed for the desire of eternal youth for centuries. Our body is able to renew itself or, more precisely, its own cells , in a completely natural way . This process is called autophagy or autophagocytosis and means from the Latin translated “auto” itself and from the Greek “phagein” to digest .

The 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for research into the mechanisms of this phenomenon. The Japanese Nobel Prize laureate, Yoshinori Ohsumi, used yeast cells to investigate what exactly happens in autophagy and what role they play in human health. In this way, the cell biologist was able to demonstrate the effect of cell renewal

But how exactly does your own “cell rejuvenation” work?

Your organism does not waste resources. Building blocks that are damaged or defective, such as incorrectly folded proteins or individual components of your cells, are specifically broken down and reused. So you have an internal recycling system in your body.

Autophagy is a completely natural process for your cells and is responsible for “maintaining quality”. Imagine that within one of your cells, a certain component is no longer working properly. This cellular “garbage” is broken down and its chemical residue is reused. A small bag is formed around this cell waste within the cell and channeled into a double membrane. The resulting structure is called the autophagosome.

The autophagosome then connects to a lysosome. A lysosome is a vesicle within the cell that contains certain enzymes and is used to break down foreign substances or the body's own substances. These enzymes break down the cell waste. The recycled material is then used to produce urgently needed nutrients or other molecules for cell metabolism.

What does autophagy do?

In addition to quality control of your cell , autophagy has the task of making new molecules such as amino acids, fatty acids or carbohydrates available to your body. For example, a protein is broken down into its individual parts, the amino acids , and can be used as a building material for new proteins. Consequence: Your body renews and cleanses itself.

Your immune system also benefits. Thanks to this phenomenon, pathogens or foreign substances that have penetrated the cell can be rendered harmless. The self-healing of cells is an important topic, especially in the field of medicine. Research is carried out in this area in order to be able to counteract various diseases.


When does autophagy start?

Recycling processes take place continuously in your body. However, under normal circumstances there is little activity, but certain factors can increase it. Above all, stressful situations , such as severe cell damage , serve as autophagy triggers . This can activate autophagy or even lead to apoptosis, the programmed cell death. Among other things, this destroys potentially harmful cells 3 .

The phenomenon also occurs more intensely when there is a lack of nutrients . The lack of amino acids in particular contributes to this effect. If there are enough amino acids in the organism, a certain protein complex, also known as the TOR complex, is activated and autophagy is inhibited 2 . Among other things, the TOR complex sets muscle protein synthesis in motion.

But can we specifically activate autophagy in order to benefit from the renewal and self-cleaning of the cells? The spirits argue about this. This question is currently being investigated and actively researched in science. Here are factors that some studies have found to stimulate autophagy.

Autophagy fasting

You have probably heard of intermittent fasting before. If not, this is a temporary abstinence from food . There are different forms of this. The best known is the 16/8 method. You do without food for 16 hours and only eat food within the 8 hours. There is also the Warrior variant, which is a little more extreme, as well as other forms of fasting. With the Warrior Diet, you only eat in a time window of 4 hours and fasting for the remaining 20 hours.

My tip: Regardless of whether it is intermittent fasting or simply a balanced diet, it is always important to provide your body with enough vitamins and nutrients. If you find it difficult to eat enough fruits and vegetables every day, try our Daily Vitamins capsules! They can help you meet your needs. Also get this book ( [intermittent fasting formula](http://withkoji.com/@porsiekings) ) it'll help you get started on intermittent fasting 

How are fasting and autophagy related?

If you skip eating for a long period of time, your insulin levels will remain consistently low. The body is signaled that it is not getting enough energy from outside and it begins to use up its own energy reserves .

In this way, the glucose stores in muscles and in the liver are depleted and the fat cells are also used. Then it is the turn of the damaged cell structures and this is where autophagy begins. By reducing these structures, new reserves are made available. Conversely: Frequent food intake inhibits these processes.

What happens when you fast for 16 hours?
Most people who have discovered intermittent fasting opt for the 16/8 method. It often fits best into everyday life and is easier to implement. Here, for example, breakfast is left out and the time window of 8 hours is easily adhered to. But is 16 hours enough to activate cell renewal?

The exact number of hours at which autophagy begins cannot be clearly answered. While some are of the opinion that the process starts after 12 to 16 hours without eating, others claim that the process is only fully completed after 72 hours.

One study 6 even links autophagy to the aging process. It is claimed that autophagy, because of its great physiological role in processes such as cell cleansing, could also slow down aging. Again, the importance of meals and their frequency is pointed out. Depending on how long you go without food, autophagy is stimulated or inhibited.",1642161347

Paleo,But… is it actually “paleo”?,"Pls don’t hate me for this lol but just asking for clarification/discussion here because I’ve had this question for years. Why is it called the paleo diet if it’s not an accurate description? Graduated with a degree in anthropology and studied archaeology, particularly ancestral humans. While they didn’t eat processed foods (obviously), they most definitely ate both grains and legumes, which are both eliminated on the paleo diet. (Ex: “Ötzi” the iceman- he had partially digested einkorn (ancient corn) found in his preserved digestive system.) And when it comes to the goal of eating like the ancestors, we’re technically unable to because almost all modern crops have been bred to be completely different from their ancient counterparts. So I guess the question is.. why is it called the paleo diet if it’s not an accurate description? I eat mostly paleo and did AIP for a while to address 2 autoimmune issues, so not asking to be a tool/to criticize the diet, just genuinely wanted to ask peoples’ opinions!

Although we have been taught to be scared of fat, the truth is that fat is a friend and a better friend than we could have ever thought of.

Sure we need fat to ensure we’ve got beautiful skin, hair and nails, but it goes beyond that.

Fat packs a bang as it has twice as many calories as carbohydrates and protein per gram.

That’s why you can have coffee and butter for breakfast and rocket through the morning.

You could try eating a few rolls of bread and you wouldn’t make it past that 10 AM hump.

The Ketogenic Diet is designed to pull your body out of the sugar track.

And when you pull out there will be no going back.

You are going to be satiated and feel wonderful focus, additionally, you’re going to feel the type of energy you likely haven’t felt since you were a toddler.

So let’s do the Ketogenic Diet breakdown and answer all those burning questions you have.

And soon after we will get started on your amazing transformative journey to the best you ever.

# Ketogenic Diet Outline

### How Carbs Affect Your Weight

***Question: Name me food that tastes “oooh so good” but is bad for you?***

Do donuts come to your mind?

A bag of potato chips?

A greasy slice of pizza?

What about a Snickers bar?

Wherever your food pleasure lies, chances are; that it is steeped in sugary carbs.

According to the USDA, the average American consumes 150-170lb of sugar each year.

Back in the early 1800s, the average American sugar intake was only 4-6lb per year.

Man, how times have changed.

***With all being said, how do carbs affect your bodyweight?***

The answer to that is… Water weight.

You can thank glycogen for this.

Glycogen is a form of glucose stored in the liver and muscle tissues and the primary dietary source of glucose is carbohydrate.

Medical science shows that every 1 gram of glycogen carries 3 to 4 grams of water.

***Research has proven that a high carb intake increases glycogen levels while low-carb intake reduces it.***

So, if you take into account that the average man can store up to 7 grams of glycogen per pound of body weight, that’s enough to make a huge impact on the weight scale, particularly if he consumes a copious amount of carbs.

### Wait, So Body Fat Is Not A Factor?

Yes, body fat is definitely a factor.

In fact, ever since people started consuming more carbs (sugar), the U.S. obesity rates have risen.

The number of U.S. citizens who are categorized as obese has nearly doubled over the past 30 years.

You see the correlation now between body fat and carbs? If not, there is one more piece of information I would like to share.

In addition to being stored in the liver and muscle tissues, glycogen is stored in fat cells.

This is the same glycogen that holds 3 to 4 grams of water.

***By lowering carb intake, you deplete your regular stores of glycogen which shows as weight loss on a scale.***

This is the reason an obese person who follows a low-carb diet will always lose more weight versus a slimmer person; they carry more fat cells (each containing water-holding glycogen).

So if an obese individual decided to follow the ketogenic diet, they are bound to drop a substantial amount of weight.

However, it is much greater than the low carb part of the diet that makes weight loss a reality.

### Keto Helps You Lose Weight

Numerous studies have touted the weight loss benefits of a low-carb diet.

***The keto diet enhances this benefit.***

How so? The low carb intake makes your body produce ketones in the liver to be used as energy (called ketosis), a byproduct of burning body fat.

Reducing carbs allows the body to use glycogen buildup within your fat stores as fuel, resulting in weight loss.

This effect is doubled when you burn glycogen by exercise.

***Let me say this about weight loss….***

When people say they want to lose weight, they typically mean they desire to lose body fat.

However, you could lose weight by losing muscle mass and water weight as well.

Most diets have you losing all three.

In case you didn’t know, losing muscle mass is rarely a good thing.

Unlike high-carb diets, keto burns body fat along with the water weight within it.

When in a state of ketosis, the body begins to utilize fat for fuel.

In addition, the moderate protein intake protects your muscle tissue from being used as fuel (a process called Gluconeogenesis).

***How sweet is that?***

# Health Benefits Of A Keto Diet

Fat is a cleaner fuel for our body to burn and our body burns it more efficiently.

In fact, it is believed the ketones produced when you are in ketosis are super amazing for our brain.

It is believed they increase mitochondria cells.

You may remember from grade 6 science class that mitochondria are the powerhouses of our cells, they are the energy factories.

Additionally, blood sugar levels become balanced, there are no nasty spikes in insulin which can lead to a host of health problems.

Balanced blood sugar also means your brain and body are calm and focused.

You are also satiated on the ketogenic diet so there are no urges to pick up those unhealthy processed foods that wreak havoc on your body.

Overall on a ketogenic diet, you have more energy, you are more focused, you drop all excess weight and will feel better than you have ever felt in your life.

Some other interesting benefits include:

#### 1. Keto Helps Lower Risk Of Developing Chronic Diseases By Improving Cholesterol

What does type-2 diabetes, stroke, and heart disease have in common? All chronic diseases that the keto diet can help prevent.

One study conducted on an obese individual who followed the ketogenic diet for 24 weeks, resulted in a significant risk reduction in chronic diseases by weight loss, decreased levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and blood glucose, and increased levels of HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol).

Being that heart disease, diabetes, and stroke are three of the leading causes of death in the world, it is phenomenal to have a diet combat them.

Keto eliminates processed, refined carbs that have been linked to several diseases, including obesity, heart disease, and type-II diabetes.

In fact, the development of type-II diabetes is strongly contributed to continuously eating high glycemic foods (e.g., whole grains, bran, germ) that spikes your blood sugars.

Another chronic disease that correlates with those other three is high blood pressure.

#### 2. Keto Lowers Blood Pressure

High blood pressure (HBP) is one of those diseases that gets swept under the rug in terms of how lethal it is for a person’s health.

***That’s why it has been dubbed the “the silent killer.”***

If left untreated, HBP can lead to:

* Stroke
* Heart disease
* Peripheral artery disease
* Erectile dysfunction
* Kidney damage
* Angina
* Fluid in the lungs
* Vision loss
* Memory loss

Be aware that these aren’t symptoms of HBP.

HBP is a symptomless disease for most people except in most rare cases known as hypertensive crisis.

***If you or your family have a history of high blood pressure, following a low-carb diet, may be a godsend.***

Medical researchers tout low-carb diets like keto as an effective method to reduce blood pressure.

If you take high blood pressure medication, please consult with your doctor first before trying this diet out.

One way that people develop high blood pressure is by eating too many refined carbs over a lengthy period of time.

The reason most people consume so many refined carbs is due to how poorly it satisfies their appetite.

#### 3. Keto Prevents Binge Eating

The number one reason most diets fail long-term is that they leave people hungry as heck!

They allow the consumption of low satiety foods such as white potatoes, rice, and bread.

Eating these foods eventually leads people to unfollow their diet and eat every calorie under the sun (aka binge eating).

***That’s not the case with the ketogenic diet.***

Research illustrates that a high protein, low-carb diet reduces hunger and lowers food intake.

In addition, the amount of dietary fat you’ll consume will leave you very satiated.

Another problem with most other diets is that they’re energy zappers.

That’s not the case when you go “keto.”

#### 4. Keto Boosts Energy Levels By Boosting Brain Power

Who doesn’t need more energy in this hustle and bustle world?

***Following a ketogenic diet helps many individuals gain more energy to perform their day to day activities.***

The main reason for this is; ketones replace glucose as the brain’s fueling source.

When carbs are eliminated or minimized, ketones provide up to 70% of the brain’s energy needs; this boosts mental focus and alertness throughout the day.

Another interesting fact is that ketones keep people who go through prolonged periods of starvation (e.g., coma patients) alive.

Then again, it makes sense considering that intermittent fasting works well in conjunction with the keto diet.

**Read more:** If you want a new [custom meal plan you can access it here](https://mealscritic.com/custom%20keto%20meal%20plans). Custom Keto Diet Plan is a personalized keto diet plan that customizes the keto diet just for you, based on your goals, tastes, body type and lifestyle.

# Intermittent Fasting On The Keto Diet

Intermittent fasting maximizes weight loss benefits of the Keto Diet.

The main reason you are reading this article is that you’re interested in losing weight, that’s understandable.

***With that said, using intermittent fasting (IF) along with the keto diet maximizes weight loss.***

IF is a term for an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

Like the keto diet, several studies have shown IF to be an effective weight-loss method as well as reducing the onset of chronic diseases such as type-II diabetes.

That’s why it makes sense to use IF in conjunction with the ketogenic diet.

**These are the 3 most popular IF methods:**

* **Eat-Stop-Eat:** This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week.
* **The 16/8 Method:** This method involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, for example from 12 pm to 8 pm, afterward, you “fast” for 16 hours in-between.
* **The 5:2 Diet:** On two non-consecutive days of the week, only eat 500-600 calories. You eat normally for the other remaining 5 days.

From these three methods, elements of the 16/8 Method work best with the keto diet.

At the end of this article, you will see a 30-Day Keto Diet Meal Plan with a full collection of recipes.

With this meal plan, you skip breakfast every 3 days, doing this makes you fast longer which helps to:

* Burn more body fat
* Have more energy as you start your day
* Reduce chronic inflammation
* Improve brain function
* Thoroughly cleanse toxins from body cells

Utilizing IF and keto together helps you lose unwanted inches off your waist.

Like a Friday the 13th movie, there are several versions of the keto diet.

Here are the four most popular ones.

# Different Types Of Ketogenic Diets

1. **The targeted ketogenic diet (TKD):** This version is where you can consume carbs around a workout.
2. **The standard ketogenic diet (SKD):** This version focuses on high-fat, moderate protein, low-carb diet. It typically contains 75% fat, 20% protein, and only 5% carbs.
3. **The cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD):** This version involves periods of higher-carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.

**High-protein ketogenic diet:** This version is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs. While embarking on this keto diet journey, below are the foods that you need to ignore like a spam phone call.

# Foods To Avoid On Keto

* White potatoes
* Alcohol
* Bread, pasta, tortillas, and other foods that contain gluten
* Condiments such as ketchup, soy sauce, and barbecue sauce that contain sugar, artificial ingredients, excessive salt, or gluten
* Corn (including popcorn, cornbread, and popped corn chips)
* Foods that contain high-fructose corn syrup or trans (hydrogenated)fats
* Foods that contain sugar, artificial sweeteners, or soy
* Fruit juice (even 100% fresh!)
* Grain-based foods (e.g., wheat, barley, rye, cereal, oatmeal)
* Jams, jellies, pancake syrup
* High sugar dairy products (e.g., ice cream)
* Salty processed snacks (potato chips, popcorn, pretzels, nacho chips, crackers, popcorn)
* Sugary processed snacks (cakes, cookies, cupcakes, candy)
* Sweetened drinks such fruit punch, lemonade and soda

Now that you know what foods to avoid, here are the foods (along with supplements) that you can embrace.

# Foods To Eat On Keto

Your diet should consist primarily of fats if you are trying to get into ketosis.

Essentially, in the first two weeks, known as the induction phase, no more than 50 grams of your calories should be coming from carbohydrates.

If you are very active, you can increase that carb intake by 20 to 30 grams.

Your protein consumption should also be limited and a good rule of thumb is to allow yourself 1 gram of protein for every 2 pounds of your weight.

There are many super delicious foods you can eat as you make your way into ketosis.

# Tips Before You Start

* You can prepare your weekday lunches and dinners on Sunday.
* An easy way to do this is to cook proteins together in one plan and then divide them up for the separate recipes.
* So for example, if you have Chicken Caesar and a Chicken Curry scheduled in one week, you can cook the chicken in one pan and then use half of it for the salad and mix in the other half with your curry sauce.
* Of course, you can cook things separately but this speeds things up and saves you time.
* If your recipe calls for raw vegetables like lettuce, remember to package them separately from the main dish you will reheat come mealtime.
* You will prepare breakfasts every day but they are all very easy and most of them take no longer than 5 minutes to prepare.
* You can prepare smoothies the night before if you want.
* Remember you will use certain things like butter and oil every week so buy those in bulk.
* If you can’t find a certain vegetable you are welcome to sub with another vegetable that is low in sugars.
* Ensure there are at least 12 hours between your last and first meal, longer if you can hold it.
* This puts your body into a fasting state and helps you burn fat faster.
* Remember to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day.
* An easy way to do this is to fill up a 50 oz bottle of water so you can track your progress throughout the day.
* Try to incorporate a little exercise in your weeks, it can be as simple as going for walks or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
* Remember a little movement goes a long way!

# Wrapping It All Up

After your first four weeks on the Ketogenic Diet, you have likely seen a massive difference in your weight and overall body function.

Switching gears from a sugar-fuelled body to a fat-fuelled body is amazingly uplifting.

You should have seen a great increase in your mental cognition.

Your energy levels should be through the roof.

And you have to have dropped several sizes.

Remember, the Ketogenic Diet is not so much a diet as a lifestyle.

You can continue to feel as amazing as you do now as long as you follow just a few simple keto rules.

Remember to stay away from unhealthy carbs; stick to unprocessed foods and allow fat to be your friend.

Congratulations on your wonderful journey and welcome to a whole new you!

# Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. What Is Ketosis?

Ketosis is a natural process the body initiates to help us survive when food intake is low, particularly of carbohydrates.

During this process, we produce ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fats in the liver.

#### 2. How Long Does It Take To Reach Optimal Ketosis?

Warning: The keto diet takes time for your body to get adjusted to it.

With that said, reaching optimal ketosis could about 3-7 days, depending on your body type, activity levels, and what you’re eating.

However, how strict you’re with your carb intake leads your body to reach ketosis faster.

#### 3. Do I Need To Count Calories?

While calories do matter—especially with weight loss—you don’t really have to count calories while following a keto diet because the protein and fat will keep you satisfied.

#### 4. Can I Drink Alcohol?

Alcohol can be consumed but be cognizant of how much and what type you’re drinking.

Wine, beer, and cocktails all have carbohydrates in them.

While it is best to avoid alcohol altogether, one glass of wine out per week won’t hurt.

#### 5. Can I Eat Too Much Fat?

Technically, yes you can eat too much fat and gain weight.

However, most people will find it difficult to overeat on high fat, high protein and low-carb diets.

To ensure you don’t overeat, there are online keto calculators to help you out in this department.

#### 6. What Foods Should I Eat?

Check out the list of keto-approved foods we mentioned earlier.

In a nutshell, stay away from high-carb foods and condiments.

These foods are:

* Candy
* Chocolate
* Bread
* Pasta
* Rice
* Potato chips
* Tomato sauce
* Salad dressing
* Ketchup
* Barbecue sauce

#### 7. How Can I Track My Carb Intake?

Following the keto diet will naturally have your carb intake low.

However, there are smartphone health apps such as MyFitnessPal that makes it easy to track your carb intake.

#### 8. How Much Weight Will I Lose?

How much weight you lose depends on several factors (e.g., genetics, gender, current health level, etc.).

Of course, exercising and living a more active lifestyle — in conjunction with the keto diet — will help you lose weight faster.

#### 9. What Are The Common Mistakes People Make When Doing The Keto Diet?

The three most common mistakes people make are:

* Consuming too much protein
* Mistaking any low-carb diet for very low-ketogenic dieting
* Not allowing for a long enough adaptation period

#### 10. What Are The Potential Dangers And Side Effects Of Keto &amp; How To Cure Them?

When your body is suddenly exposed to a new way of eating, side effects are a likely occurrence.

With that said, the keto diet does have its side effects but they are all curable.

#### Side Effect &amp; How To Cure Them:

* **Headaches:** Drink water with salt sprinkled in it.
* **Feeling tired and cranky:** Eat more fat.
* **Leg cramps:** Drink water with salt &amp; supplement with magnesium.
* **Constipation:** Drink more water, add extra salt to foods&amp; eat more high fiber, non-starchy vegetables.
* **Bad breath:** Brush your teeth and tongue more often. Eat a few more carbs if the smell becomes a long-term issue.
* **Reduced exercise performance:** Drink plenty of water with salt prior to exercising. Be patient because it will take time for your body to adjust from being a sugar-burner to burning primarily fat for energy, even in the muscles.",1641701867

Paleo,In search for the healthiest diet,"Dear community, 

As I have been interested in nutrition and health/food topics for a long time I researched and tried nearly every diet out there. My goal is not necessarily to lose weight (as I am at a normal weight), but to become healthier and live a long life.
Recently I’ve looked into the vegan diet again (several years ago I was vegetarian for 1 year and vegan for roughly 4 months), but was very skeptical towards the many processed foods and substitutes, as well as the nearly dogmatic demonization of animal protein (even towards small amounts of grass fed unprocessed meat for example).
Therefore I am now looking again into the paleo diet (I gathered some information about it some years ago) and like the aspect of eating clean, unprocessed natural food.
I am only hesitating because I’ve read many times during my research that meat and other animal products are heavily linked to cancer, which is my biggest fear. 
My questions are:
1. Why are all those study’s linking meat to cancer?
2. Which are benefits of the paleo diet regarding cancer prevention?
3. Do you have any general advice for someone starting paleo?

Thank you so so much in advance and please excuse the long text and my bad English

I have been eating pretty poorly (I eat one healthy meal and one big unhealthy meal almost daily). I fast intermittently, but I always crave junk. Always. It sucks. So my questions are,


1) How do I go about this? Is paleo right for me?

2) Are there any dangers I need to know about before starting this?

Paleo,"Created an app, I hope it helps!","Background: My best friend—and fellow programmer—was going through some massive digestive issues that weren’t getting better regardless of what the doctor was recommending. He searched everywhere on the internet to learn as much as he could and was able to get things managed through diet and exercise. He had a vision to build an app to help other people discover their triggers and help them solve it. Thus, HealthyYouApp was born.  
 

We began working it out how it would all function a few years ago, but we’ve been more heavily involved in the project over the past year. Just recently came out of a beta and added some additional content via recipe generator—user suggested. There is a predictive coding in place to help sort your potential triggers from food based on input through UPC or Manual Scanned food.  
 

Currently, we are still in proof-of-concept phase. We have a huge vision for the app in the future, but we need users—and their feedback—to help us get there. We’ve been awarded a sponsorship from Microsoft, which helped to pay for all our infrastructure costs, as well as tooling for the next year. After that, we do have plans on how we want to monetize the app via integrations and some other things we have cooking up.  
 

There are several things we know about future monetization. First, we will never sell user data. We’re all big believers in user privacy and plan to keep it that way. Second, we want to try and keep it free for the user. There may be a time where we must switch to a Freemium model to help support the costs if our other ideas don’t come to fruition.

So please, take the time to download the app from [https://www.healthyyouapp.com](https://www.healthyyouapp.com/). Help give us some meaningful feedback. And we’ll try and help you, become the healthiest version of yourself in the future!",1640893377

For the past month I thought I had dementia. It felt like I was losing my mind. For weeks on end I would have to remind myself where I was driving, forgetting what exit on the highway my destination was, I had to stop working because ideas wouldn't register in my head, experienced extreme dizziness,  lightheadedness that made me think I was about to pass out, had severe short-term memory and couldn't process new concepts or ideas. I thought I had carbon monoxide poisoning, mold toxicity, mercury poisoning, seizures, etc. I was scared for my life because the doctors at urgent care and the emergency room couldn't figure out what was wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, around 4 days ago my friends invited me to a restaurant immediately felt better after eating a burger 4 days ago though.  That's when I realized I couldn't remember the last time I had bread. I thought carbs were making me worse because anytime I had candy my short-term memory and dizziness would spike for the entire next day, and I would either feel great after eating fruit or worse, nothing in between. I even had small cups of rice at restaurants but thought that made me feel worse too. So I avoided carbs even more. I All this started around the time my friend convinced me to try the carnivore diet. I remembered hearing about the keto flu once and it all made sense. I didn't introduce enough fat to replace my new lack of carbs. My diet turned into eggs in the morning and chicken or salmon at night. 

&amp;#x200B;

My blood tests didn't show anything wrong. My glucose levels were in the normal range. But I never got a blood test previously so I have nothing to compare it to. I also got a glucometer because a friend mentioned I might have diabetes but that showed I was in the normal range. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I seem to be improving the more I introduce complex carbs. But eating deep-fried food or candy seem to bring back short-term memory symptoms and dizziness.

Paleo,Protein on a Dairy Free Calorie Restricted Diet,"I originally posted this in another subreddit but thought it may be a better fit here.

(30F) I usually don’t do this seeking advice thing when it comes to my diet because there’s just so much conflicting information and opinions out here. I try to listen to my body and see what it needs. That’s been serving me well but age has brought a few health issues along with it and I’m finding it increasingly difficult to eat well and feel well. As I’ve rounded the corner to 30 I’ve discovered I’m gluten intolerant, lactose intolerant, and my stomach is just all around cranky and inflamed. Legumes are an absolute no no for me as well. I take 2000mg Metformin ER for PCOS, a condition that causes insulin resistance (I am not diabetic) and it is not tolerated well. I have a lot of GI issues. Extreme bloating (sometimes it feels like my stomach is going to rupture, I’m in so much pain) and general soreness are daily events. I have just about cut out gluten completely and it has helped me immensely but my stomach is still in distress. I believe it may be the metformin but I think that eliminating dairy from my diet would alleviate some of my sufferingp. I already have so many dietary restrictions, letting go of this one thing is proving to be unnecessarily difficult.

**If additional background information is needed: I am 5’8 and roughly 270 lbs. Large frame. I am pretty active. I work 50 hrs a week on my feet, constant motion, and workout (cardio and weight lifting) for at least an hour at a minimum 3x weekly (the working out is a new addition to my lifestyle).

My restrictions are as follows:

No Gluten
No Legumes
No Dairy
At least 50% raw plant based
Minimal processed “foods”
Minimal carbs aside from fresh fruit
Approx 1400 calories a day.

A good chunk of my protein intake comes from yogurt and cheeses. How can I remove dairy from my diet and still get the necessary macronutrients, namely protein?

Paleo,how to calculate nutritional data from raw to cooked meat?,"Hello Fam,

&amp;#x200B;

After some digestive issues starting to happen to me this year I have decided to try paleo and see if cutting out grains helps me at all.  I have always been very fit and healthy but I want to see if my problems go away.  for some reason I still had problems after breakfast but not the rest of the day.  SO I eliminated eggs and my issues went away.  guess I can't have either egg white or egg yolk but im not going to waste my time seeing which one I can and cannot eat because im not going to waste half an egg to eat.   

that being said, I will be eating more meat, and staying away from grains and continuing paleo without eggs.  how do I calculate my protein and fat from raw to cooked meat?

&amp;#x200B;

for example I get really good local pasture raised 90% ground beef.  for breakfast and lunch I eat either 6oz or 8oz raw depending on how hungry I am.  I cook it but I start out with that weight.

&amp;#x200B;

how would Calculate what I am eating after cooking that?  I am very new to this so I don't even know if I am getting the right amount of fat but I am pretty solid on 120g of carbs a day, I am shooting for 80 grams of fat.  and what ever three servings of 6 to 8 oz of beef or chicken is a day protein wise plus collagen for extra protein.  I am 6/1 175 M

&amp;#x200B;

I am open to all feedback positive or negative on whatI am doing and would love some help!

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even begin to describe how much better I feel with out eggs in my life!  such a trip I should probably do an allergy test.

Paleo,Need some good high-calorie vegetables. Also some questions regarding potatoes and some legumes.,"I am looking for high calorie vegetables. Obviously quite hard as, working in a Mexican restaurant, grains, corn, and beans are off the table.

So far I really only have yams and sweet potatoes. What are some other calorie dense vegetables I can go for? I can only hand so much meat, and while veggies like broccoli, carrots, and red/orange/yellow bell peppers are good they are more beneficial for nutrients than for actual calories.

The bit about yams and sweet potatoes kind of brings me to my next question: how are these paleo, but potatoes are not? As far as I can see a potato would be paleo... if you're a caveman and find a potato growing in a field you pluck it and eat it. Simple as that. Same for peanuts and peas. What makes them not paleo because it seems just like if I went back in time... and came across them as a hunter-gatherer... can't possibly see how they would be adapted to eat.",1638548728

Paleo,Brain fog after restrictive eating,"Hey guys. I’ve been dealing with brain fog and uncomfortable symptoms in my body that gradually occurred after I was restricting my eating when I was a high performing endurance athlete. I had to quit my career and my symptoms has ruined my life. I can’t seem to figure out how to normalize myself even though I’ve quit my sport and started to eat more food.

As an athlete I would eat a lot of sugar and carbs during competition and I would restrict myself a lot when I was working out. I would mainly eat protein and obviously my body would not get enough energy. I think my brain fog symptoms started to come because my low blood sugar because I was not eating enough. Could this have made some sort of damage on my system/brain?

I’ve tried a lot of diets after getting ill. Now, 2 years after I got ill I’ve started to struggle with appetite symptoms again even though I’m eating 2500-3000 calories a day and I’m not more active than just taking a walk during the day. Is this some sort of insulin problem? My blood work is fine. Could I have damaged something else when I was restricting myself? Thanks",1638501397
Paleo,Can I get a critique on my current diet plan?,"I don't necessarily subscribe to any particular ""diet"", though I guess what I do eat is most closely aligned with Paleo which is why I'm posting here. I've been eating like this for a few months now and my weight has remained constant without my needing to track calories like I have in the past. I'm pretty happy with my weight right now though I wouldn't mind gaining 5lbs of muscle.

Currently I eat something like:

Breakfast:
- 4 or 5 eggs 
- Usually with like half of an avocado. 
- Occasionally I'll eat some ground pork patties or bacon but that's maybe once every two weeks

Snack:
- Not every day, but if I do it's usually a bowl of full fat greek yogurt with some blueberries, almonds and honey

Lunch:
- A pound of ground beef patties, with some cheese on top
- Sometimes the other half of that avocado
- A piece of fruit. I like to eat guava, apple bananas or pineapple usually

Dinner:
- Steak (I prefer ribeye but since it's pricey it's not every night. otherwise, it's sirloin or other cuts). Anywhere from 0.8-1lbs worth
- Occasionally either some rice or potatoes
- Also occasionally some green vegetable like broccoli or whatever 
- Another piece of fruit like the ones mentioned above

Everything mentioned is local/grass-fed/pasture raised yadda yadda yadda. When I cook my meats eggs it's usually in either butter or tallow.

I have the occasional cheat meal where I eat some bad shit (pizza, alcohol, something in a tortilla). That's maybe once per month tops.

As I mentioned, I would prefer to start adding a little more muscle (I'm at like 10ish% bf right now but could use more bulk esp. in my upper body). I guess the good news is that I feel like I could eat more since what I eat doesn't leave me completely stuffed or anything.

Should I eat more eggs for breakfast? More cheese/butter? Am I eating too many fruits? Any other tips?",1638397211

I'm about 3 weeks into my paleo transition and I started tracking calories to see if I was eating a healthy amount, as I started feeling very weak and dizzy after a while. For my current weight I'd need to eat about 2,600 calories to maintain (which I'm definitely not trying to do, looking for weight loss), but I was averaging 1,200, sometimes closer to 1,000 calories, up to maybe 1,500 on a good day (very occasionally closer to 1,800 if I had a really rich meal like a steak with sides). Could this be the cause of the feeling weak and dizzy? My water intake has been relatively good as well.   


A typical day of eating would be:  


Breakfast: a mashed sweet potato with half a banana and some pecans, or a sausage/egg/potato mixture, very occasionally I'll skip breakfast but most days I try to make sure I eat something in the morning

Lunch: half a chicken breast with some kind of veggie (usually half a cup to a cup of veggies) and some kind of roasted potatoes, or salmon or a small pork chop instead of chicken

Dinner: usually a variation of lunch

I eat mostly on small ""salad"" plates to avoid over eating, as I've struggled significantly with disordered/binge and restricting eating most of my life, so I just put what will fit on my plate and avoid going for seconds, unless I'm still hungry, which I rarely am since adopting this way of eating.

Paleo,Paleo Autoimmune Friendly Cookbook?,"I went on the Paleo diet for about a year or two, about a decade ago, and stopped because life got in the way (not enough time/energy/resources to cook). Am thinking about trying again, if I can, I don't often have the energy to cook so I'll do what I can. i seem to have a lot of food intolerances/allergies (increasing every year). The reactions vary but some things trigger asthma/phlegm/trouble breathing, some trigger fatigue, a few I start feeling numbness/tingling in my mouth/face. 

I feel like I need to do *something*. Ideally I'd love to leave leave the US, it seems when I traveled to other countries I can eat the foods that I can't eat in the US. Someone told me that that the US processes foods differently (and uses different pesticides) and that might be a factor.

From trial and error these are things I need to AVOID:

* ALL NUTS AND SEEDS (coconut, almond, pumpkin seeds, etc). 

* Most grains (particularly wheat)

* many fruits (apples, blueberries, pineapple, mangos, maybe pears, I tend to avoid fruit, but there may be new ones I don't know of yet)

* ALL DAIRY (goat, cow etc)

* ALL EGGS

* SHELLFISH (I seem ok with regular fish)

* bananas I can have on a limited basis

* SUGAR (cane sugar is not good)

* ALL SWEETENERS (except honey or maple syrup, molasses might be ok)

Right now I seem ok with corn and rice for grains. I eat them on a limited basis. Oatmeal I'm starting to have reactions to and might have to stop at some point. 

I can have soy on a limited basis (will start getting tired and cold if I have too much). I know it's not autoimmune, but I eat soy yogurt. I will probably try to make it so it doesn't have so much sugar.

I seem ok with tomatoes and potatoes, even though they are restricted (though I saw potatoes might not be now). I seem ok with peas and beans on a limited basis. 


I saw that The Healing Kitchen has autoimmune friendly recipes for instant pot. I'm going to see if I can get ahold of it.

Our oven is broken (landlord won't fix it and I'm too exhausted to fight it, hopefully one day we'll move but rents and everything have gone up and less income so not likely any time soon).

Paleo,Paleo apparently does not work for me. Any thoughts?,"I tried everything. 

High carb (with sweet potato, cassava, plantains, and several other tubers): hypoglycemic and extremely tired right after eating, leading to mood swings and more cravings. Never had any energy to run or work out. I did this for a month testing with several sources of carbs like the mentioned plus white rice.

Moderate carb (without tubers, only non-starchy vegetables): felt okay (mentally), but couldn't sit down to play my games on PC due to bloating after every meal. 

Low carb: yesterday I did a 64 minutes cardio session while fasting for more than 16 hours and felt amazing, could go for more and I was not even hungry after came home. Today since it was legs day I did eat an avocado with meat before going just to have a little more of strength, and I felt like I'm readapting well to running on fat. But then, if I break my fast with a meal containing like 25 net carbs (the only vegetables I'm keeping around since I eliminated everything else due to cravings are onions and tomatoes, but from today tomatoes are off the list as well), I have low blood sugar symptoms and there am I wanting to eat the world afterwards. It's like my brain switches to running on glucose, but since I don't eat enough to keep it running from a meal to another (and I don't plan to), I feel miserable unless I eat carbs again. Overnight I ""reset"" and wake up well, with no appetite whatsoever. The only vegetables that don't make me feel like trash are cabbage, cauliflower and lettuce, but they make too much volume in my stomach.  

I'm thinking of switching to a diet with no carbs at all (with my only source of fiber being chia seeds), but I'd like to receive some insight. I don't know if that matters but I have a BMI of 21.5 (I had less before and am pursuing it again).",1636061727

Paleo,Is this a good diet to start with? I'm considering doing it,"I have a brother who is eating based on the Paleo diet for years now and he's in a good shape. I'm on the other hand 103kg and I'd like to go down towards the 90kg mark...

What he told me he's doing is this - I'm considering doing the same:

**Breakfast:**

1) 3 cucumbers

2) 1 pepper

3) Sour cream with 15g fat

4) You can have your coffee with an addition of a small amount of sweet cream with high fat.

**Lunch:**

1) 300-400g of lean meat or fish

2) Vegetables if any - optional

**Dinner:**

1) 70g of variety of nuts (e.g. walnuts, almonds, pistachios, pecan) - it just has to be 70g, no more.

2) Coffee with an addition of a small amount of sweet cream with high fat.

Once a week and only once a week you can eat a bit more than that (i.e. +carbs, bread etc. but don't overdo it).

Paleo,Low Energy Except for Potatoes - Advice?,"I have a long-running issue with my energy. Hoping someone has some advice to help me get it back!

First off, Paleo's helped me a lot. I dropped 80 pounds on it, got lots of energy back, and improved my sleep.

The thing is, the tradeoff came in low energy levels. I'm not exhausted all the time...just most days, I don't have that much get-up-and-go.

The exception comes when I eat white potatoes. Regardless of their form, my body always has the same reaction:

* 1-3 hours of incredible energy
* The energy drops off and I feel sleepy for about an hour
* Energy levels go back to normal

I dropped potatoes early on because it helped me lose more weight. My system likes potatoes, but it also likes packing on pounds from the same potatoes.

If it helps further, here's my typical daily diet:

1. Breakfast: Bacon and/or eggs, kale chips, and a couple strawberries or a few plantain chips
2. Lunch: Turkey burger patty, salad, vegetable noodles or sweet potato noodles
3. Dinner: Protein (chicken/beef/salmon), 1-2 roasted vegetables like Brussels sprouts or broccoli, and either a sweet potato or roasted parnsip (some complex starch)
4. Snacks: Jerky, cashews, raisins, or a banana

Paleo,Please allow me this rant.,"My first awakening around food began two years ago, when every morning I would wake up so tired I'd have to concentrate on surviving the day. It wasn't a life I wanted to live. On a lark, I tried a 16-hour fast and it absolutely blew my mind. The peaceful clarity with which I woke up the following morning was a way I no longer remembered feeling and it was my first clue that the answer to my chronic fatigue lay somewhere in how I ate. 

Since then I continued to do intermittent fasting, got in shape, and went plant-based. I felt better to the degree that I became functional, but the struggle remained and, with the stress of the last two years, got worse. 

Until last week, again, on a lark, I dropped all grains, legumes, and sugar, and holy fucking Moses. What a revelation! My energy smoothed out, no post-lunch crash, no brain fog. It's like I've been retarded for the last twenty years and didn't even know it because feeling like dogshit became my baseline.

And how about the emotional detox, which is probably why I'm writing this post. My childhood was quite traumatic and food was how I numbed out. All my life I considered myself a food addict. Now I'm seeing that what I crave is actually not all food but very specific things. Bread, sugar, starches, legumes, all that good stuff. Hell, even lentils. All the food I'd reach for at two in the morning despite being full and knowing I'm making myself sick, it's always the things that the paleo diet asks one to drop.

Meanwhile, my oh so voluminous farts from a daily diet of grain and beans are 95% gone. My halitosis is gone. My mind is clean. I feel so raw and alive. 

And from my newfound overwakeful clarity I think, what the fuck? In Sapiens, Yuval Harari argues that agriculture was a mistake and that human beings actually got domesticated by grain, which, thanks to us, has done quite well. I don't have the source, but remember reading that wheat acts on our opioid receptors. I'm aware that the advent of agriculture was a multifaceted event in our history, yet I wonder, given how much I've been addicted to all things post-agriculture, whether the folks that first pimped farming were addicted as well.

And I wonder how many of us are now walking around feeling like zombies and not even knowing it because for the last ten thousand fucking years it's all most of us knew. 

I don't have a conclusion for this, but if you also experienced healing of your body and mind by changing how you eat I'd love to read about it, and if you're wondering whether going paleo will help you live your life more fully, honestly, I don't know. People are different. But if your gut says it's something worth giving a shot, I hope my experience will encourage you to try.

Paleo,Favorite homemade Italian dressing recipe that comes close to store brands?,"Does anyone here have a favorite homemade Italian dressing recipe that comes close to the flavor of store brands (Kraft, Wish Bone, Ken's? Steak House)? 

Italian dressings in general seem to have the following ingredients: garlic, onion, red bell pepper, various seasonings (oregano, basil, marjoram, rosemary and thyme seem to be the most common), and some type of oil and acid (vinegar and/or lemon juice).

The store brands also have sugar and canola/soybean oil but obviously I would be omitting those.

I've tried the Primal Kitchen Italian Dressing and it's not bad but the ratio of oil to vinegar seems low (probably done to hit certain cost and nutritional targets) plus the flavor seems kind of bland compared to the store brands so I thought I'd try making my own.",1634584681
Paleo,"Protein Powder on Paleo - Is it ""allowed""? Any brands I should avoid or use?","Hi all, 

I'm interested in trying out Paleo for weight loss coupled with an active lifestyle of jogging, cycling, tabata and gym workouts. Already by my own design, my grocery consumption is at least 75% paleo - I just gotta cut out yogurt &amp; goat cheese, beans, bananas and these pesky Clif protein bars I love but obviously are just there for my sweet tooth (helloooooo dark chocolate here I come). 

BUT my one big hangup is protein powder. I see conflicting opinions all over the internet: whey is just a part of dairy, so it's okay/whey is cheating/you gotta buy paleo specific protein powder/all powders are super-processed so they're all banned... I don't think I can/want to give up protein powder as it's a routine snack for me and great after exercise. Can I stick to my current brand of whey isolate if that's the one item I ""cheat"" with on an otherwise adherent paleo routine? FWIW I have a protein shake almost every day and I plan to maintain a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule as well; additionally, I have no digestive issues.

PS - I'd love some educated input and not the standard ""it's really a personal choice for each individual""-type response. I know it's up to me and my goals but I'm good at taking direction and open to being educated, so I'm seeking a knowledgeable answer to what appears to be a pretty amorphous issue out there in the online community.

Paleo,Do you sometimes wonder if you should eat stuff you eat? I'm now questioning every food.,"When I look at every food group, or a specific food, I question myself ""would I eat it if I was a wild-man?"". ""Would I BE ABLE to 'process' the food with the same effect?"". ""Should I eat this?"". ""Am I eating this only because it's available in the store? Would I eat this if I found it in the wildness?""  

 
   
And because of that sometimes I feel bad because of the stuff I eat, for example white rice. From these simple thoughts about food and their agricultural production I then switch to thinking about my whole life and existence.  
Is paleo really ""healthy""? Is it adjusted to our times? How can we know HOW MUCH our genes and bodies have changed during these times, let's say in the last 10,000 years? How can I make sure, that eating grains and dairy is no better than eating typical paleo foods?  
Let's face it, most people thrive on grains and (in western world) dairy, and it doesn't look like it does that much damage. Yes, advancing medicine also comes into the play, but it's not like every 20-30 year old person needs to be put on meds just because he has been eating bread with cheese for the most of his life. Why is that? Why most people don't get sick from eating bread and dairy? Or we just don't see it because human body is so good at fighting against the 'wrong nutrients' (I'm calling it that only from the perspective of the last 10,000 years).   
  
  
Do you ever wonder about stuff like that? I mean, we can't even drink water without being dependents on the companies and present technology.    
I've been waking up with a stomachache everyday because I was eating potatoes. Once I ditched them, and switched them to white rice, the problem is gone. Something that should be worse, actually did me better. That's just an example.

So many people here and articles say that you should eat many vegetables, about 5 servings a day. But on the other hand there are people who have digestive problems and they limit their veggie intake and feel better. But those people still need micro-nutrients and are somehow fine with limited veggie intake. I am just wondering, I don't have anything against eating so many vegetables. But I myself find it pretty hard to eat as much a day. Of course you can go with some ""workarounds"" like blending them etc., but that seems pointless in a long run.    
Currently I eat about 2 veggies and 1 fruit a day. The rest is meat, eggs and rice. I don't know about rice but I think it's kind of easier to digest than 5 servings of veggies? I am wondering if eating like this would be sufficient when it comes to nutrients.

Paleo,Help with Quick and filling Lunch time snack,"I have a new part time job.  3 days a week as a teacher assistant at a preschool for children with special needs.  I’m on the clock 8:15 until 1:45 with absolutely no breaks except to run to the bathroom as needed.  It’s fast pace and because of Covid we cannot sit down and eat a snack or lunch with the kids like they apparently used to be able to do.  So it’s literally waiting for a calm moment at lunch and pulling your mask down at the far end of the room and cramming food in your face.  I’ve been observing the other teachers and assistance to see how they’re managing and they’re managing with Pepsi and donuts or chips throughout the morning😒 I am unmedicated type 2 diabetic and this is simply not an option for me.  Yesterday was my best day yet because I ate extremely dense/fatty breakfast and I packed deli ham and Swiss cheese rolled up. I was actually fine and ate a healthy snack in the car when I got out, wasn’t ravenous or anything.  I don’t want to make deli meat a habit.  I do love it so much but I’m concerned with the risk of breast cancer that it’s associated with and don’t want to do it regularly.  Any other ideas? It really needs to be something that’s like 4-5 bites and filling.  I’m a substitute and float to different rooms so no nuts  or peanut butter because some rooms have allergies.

Paleo,Roasted red pepper and goat's cheese soup - a win!,"I am SO proud of myself for making this soup from scratch this evening (I even made the chicken stock from scratch yesterday!). By way of background, I'm a 'veggie hater' - I have horrible issues with the texture of a lot of vegetables that makes me gag, so I've been working really hard at this lately. I'm also a terrible cook. So I expected this soup to be a total fail, but unbelievably it was one of the best things I've ever tasted.

I halved 3 red bell peppers and six roma tomatoes and roasted them for around 20 minutes with a bulb of garlic. Squeezed out the garlic, mashed it and put it all in a pan with half a can of coconut milk and some chicken stock (I didn't measure it, unfortunately). I seasoned with salt, pepper and chilli flakes and added two bay leaves. I let it simmer for about 40 minutes, then blended it with an immersion blender. Before eating, I mixed in a spoon of goat's cheese, which is obviously optional, but I was hoping to replicate a soup that I used to get here in the UK in a cafe called Eat. which has now closed. I'm surprised at how much it tasted like that soup.

Thanks to everyone who gave me the soup advice the other day. My confidence in being able to create and sustain a healthy lifestyle has skyrocketed!

It's been a while and things haven't improved. In the past I had a lot of energy to do stuff, but I lacked motivation. It's like I was adapted to make use of the eaten fat to use as energy, but it wouldn't go to my brain, because I didn't really want to do anything all day (low blood sugar?). Now, whenever I eat carbs (tubers, rice), I feel tired to the point of laying on bed the whole day, but on the other hand I WANT to do stuff, it's just my body that does not cooperate. I'm at my worst especially when I wake up. Is it just a matter of time to re-adapt or there is no hope for me?

Today I ate a slice of pizza and was so dizzy I couldn't get up for like 30 minutes.

I just ate some rice along with lots of grassfed butter, salmon, and broccoli, and am experiencing noticeable dizziness.

I'm just getting started on paleo. I make quite a few nice soups, but they contain dairy and I want to trial a period without it.

Omit it completely or use coconut milk, or is there a better ingredient?

Secondly, I'd like to include some meat in my soups for extra protein. This is probably a stupid question, but let's say I make mushroom and chicken soup - do I just add cooked chicken at the end and blend it?  Are there any particular flavor combinations you can recommend - ideally a non-starchy vegetable and meat combo?

So why isn’t the general conclusion more so “consume if it’s appropriate to your ancestral region”?

I wished to work out earlier in the morning like I did in the past, so I bought pears to pair them with sesame paste for a quick snack. The pear I ate before working out did not give me that boost of energy at all, but neither did it prejudice me, but the pear I ate afterwards made left me with low blood sugar (I know because I can't stop thinking about food, fatigue, bad mood etc).

Also, I don't get why fruits like pears and bananas do me no good now due to fructose, if vegetables (cabbage, carrot, onion, tomato, zucchini etc) also contain some sugar.

Paleo,DAE have this relationship with food? And were you able to over come it to stay Paleo long term?,"

I (29f) was raised in the 90s during the whole ""fat and meat are bad"" crazy. Because of this, my family gave me carte blanche to eat whatever I wanted that was ""low fat"" so basically my diet was mostly made up of very processed grains and sugars (goldfish, Cheetos, snackwells, PB&amp;J's, hostess cupcakes, etc.) I only ate meat and veggies at dinner and it usually was something either canned or frozen like Sara Lee dinners. I rarely had fresh food as my parents didn't have time to make those kind of meals and thought all of these low fat foods were healthy and there was no nutritional difference between a microwavable meal and freshly made one. 

Eating extremely sugary desserts were a major part of celebrating in my family. Not indulging in these treats was (and still is) seen as depriving yourself and missing out on the fun parts of life. I feel this guilt for not partaking in unhealthy food at get-togethers for this reason. I also eat food from my childhood as a way to comfort myself when I'm stressed or to relive happy memories. For example, my grandparents always brought donuts over on mornings they would visit. And when I miss them or those simple times from my childhood, I get a donut to feel that way again. This is obviously a horrible habit as I'm just hurting my body and the feeling of reliving those happy memories is fleeting.

Whenever I eat anything high in processed sugar or grains, all of my joint start to ache (like they do when you get the flu) within about 20 minutes. I get a headache, brain fog and I become highly irritable. This lasts for a few hours to a full day depending on what I eat. If the sugary/processed thing I ate has dairy in it, the symptoms are worse. 

When I was 21, I discovered Paleo. I lost almost 30 lbs, was in amazing shape, didn't have these weird symptoms I mentioned above and generally felt amazing. But around 24/25 I started to slip. I was working a stressful job and got injured which kept me from working out daily like I used to. Also, everyone at every job I've ever had pressures me relentlessly to eat all the treats that people bring in for the break room. If I didn't, I was seen as rude and my coworkers wouldn't stop talking about it. Couple that with stress and my poor eating habits from childhood, I fell off the wagon. 

Now at 29, I don't want to live like this anymore. I want to be completely free from processed foods and all the horrible health consequences I experience when I eat them. But with the stress of parenting a one year old, the pandemic and feeling lost in my career, I keep comforting myself with these foods from childhood which just leads to me feeling like shit. Yet I can't stop this masochistic pattern.

Paleo,[Question] Why can't I eat grain-fed beef?," Hi everybody,

so  here's the thing plaguing me ever since switching to a paleo diet:  my gut simply can't tolerate grain fed animals. And no, I'm not making  this up. It makes my life harder as it should be, since gras-fed meat is basically unheard  of here in Bavaria (to a degree that people are genuinely surprised when  being told that corn/wheat is not a cow's natural diet. I mean, come  on).

Some information on me: I got  a diagnosed and severe allergy against grains, especially wheat. Even  the tiniest traces might trigger eczema flare-ups and gut inflammation,  so buying a coffee at a bakery was sometimes enough to ruin my day. My  current supply of meat is from two local farmers who provide 100%  gras-fed/finished meat + lots of wild boar/game, which is pretty easily  (and cheaply) obtained here in Bavaria. I'm doing perfectly fine on  these, so it's definitely not a problem with meat as such. Several  incidents made me realize, that I nonetheless do react to certain types  of it.

Case Zero: made an (AIP/Wahl's Protocol) elimination diet for several months and my eczema just didn't go away.  Only after cutting out beef, which was like the last item on my list,  things got markedly better. Didn't go vegan though, but switched to  hunted animals for the time being. Later on I tried grasfed beef and to  my big surprise this worked just fine.

Case  1: I ran out of my farmer's meat, as those guys only slaughter twice a  year, so I ordered some online. They claimed their cows were grassing  during the summer months, so I thought that'll do it. After trying the  meat, I woke up with several abdominal pains the next morning, which I  only knew all too well. So I phoned them and asked if those cows really  did only eat gras. The answer was no, as they were fed ""powerfood"" (i.e.  grains) to fatten them up during winter.

Case  2: visited my parents, who bought some organic Irish beef for the  occasion. I was already skeptical, but of course I ate it as they  already went to great lengths to provide some proper food for me.  Unfortunately, the experiment resulted again in stomach pain, which  ruined the following two days for me.

So  how is this possible? I'm no biochemist, but the only explanation I can  think of is, that the proteins from the grains are not split up  entirely and certain amino-acid sequences end up intact enough in the  tissue of the animals to be recognized by my hyper alert immune system.  If anyone could point me to a study or give some further information on  this, I'd be super grateful.",1630746788

Paleo,Odd(ish) request for food ideas needed,"Hi everyone! I recently purchased a large container of deli sliced roast beef from Costco (I thought it was more like thick slices to eat with knife &amp; fork, didn't realize it was deli meat). It's just my husband , our young child &amp; I and I want to use this up so I'm looking for ideas where I can use this in something other than sandwiches. Now for the odd ask, Rosh Hashanah is coming up next week, it's not in our budget to buy a cut of meat to make brisket, could this deli sliced roast beef be used with a gravy over it instead of actual pot roast? Does anyone have gravy recipes or any other ideas we could do to use this food up?

I joined a gym solely for the purpose of gaining muscle. This is a privately owned gym which does all forms of training. On the first day, the owner and operator who is also a trainer, talked to me. **BEFORE** he asked me what I eat, have any allergies or what my eating regimen was, he gave me a run down of things to **completely** get rid of in my diet. I thought it was pretty strange, because, other than sugar, I have never heard any of the other claims. Then he emailed me that information so I can reference it. I talked to my family doctor - who knows my health very well - and she said his nutrition guide sounded like alarmist bullshit. 

He says in order to gain muscle, you have to get rid of Soy, Dairy, Sugar, Gluten and Corn. 

Why? Because it makes your muscles inflamed. And inflamed muscles slow your gains progress. That was the jist of it. 

[Here's the graphics that he sent me](https://imgur.com/a/8khKgbT). It tells you why those ingredients make your muscles inflamed.

I’m thinking just go cold turkey, make the proper food, offer the proper food and allowing them the choice of eating or not eating, but only real food options. I assume they will get hungry after a day or two and will start eating. Hoping only two weeks of hell as we all adjust.

Paleo,Need help to refine our future research efforts in glucose and ketones monitoring!,"  

Hi everyone, I’m Luca Lipani, currently a researcher at the University of Bath, UK. Our team is developing a wearable, non-invasive continuous monitoring platform for tracking several biomarkers, including glucose and ketones. 

We have already published a proof of concept of the technology for glucose tracking. [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-018-0112-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-018-0112-4) (I know it is academic and quite technical, so I would advise going through it by reading just the abstract and conclusions)

We are now expanding our research towards monitoring other biologically relevant substances (such as ketones). I understand that it could be interesting to track such substances, especially to learn how food and habits alter their levels throughout the day or even to check if you are at a specific threshold. 

I’ve developed a website with some info related to our platform ([https://vitalitybit.co.uk](https://vitalitybit.co.uk/) ), and please forgive me if it appears only sport-oriented! 

I’m reaching out to this community because I believe some of you might be interested in such technology, and please feel free to contact me if you want more info or even for an informal discussion!

I would genuinely appreciate it if you could provide some feedback in the comments or even by completing the survey that you can find on the website ([https://survey.sogosurvey.com/survey1.aspx?k=SsRQVPRQsSXsPsPsP&amp;lang=0](https://survey.sogosurvey.com/survey1.aspx?k=SsRQVPRQsSXsPsPsP&amp;lang=0) ).

Paleo,Struggling to make paleo and low histamine work.,"In the past year my doctors suspect that I have a histamine intolerance and now need to eat a low histamine diet. I’ve been paleo for roughly 2 years and I’m struggling right now. 

For those that don’t know histamines are in most foods but some are higher than others. For me steak is fine, any ground meat is not great but not bad, pork has always been bad for me, fish is case by case and shellfish right now are a no. My biggest issue is the vegetables and fruits that have been the base of my paleo diet are histamine liberators or high in histamines- spinach, tomatoes, green beans (the only legume I ate), cherries, eggplant, mushrooms, avocado, pineapple and cinnamon.  I resorted to eating rice again solely because it’s a safe food that gives me no reaction.

Has anyone else dealt with this or have recipes they can share? My body functions the best on paleo, but I can’t live with the pain the high histamine foods cause.",1628008209
Paleo,Finding it hard to get to 2000 kcal without grains and dairy.,"Hi,  
I have no idea how can I eat 2000 kcal a day without grains and dairy. I don't want to lose/gain weight. After counting calories it turns out that I would have to eat so much eggs and potatoes everyday just to make it up. I eat 400g/0.88lbs of meat and it usually has around 1000 kcal (including added lard). So I have to get the other 1000 kcal somehow. Veggies including potatoes are like 200-300 kcal max of what my stomach capacity is capable of. Having more than 5 eggs is also hard, and 5 eggs are about 400 kcal.  
And it's still only after ""pushing"" myself to eat all of that food: 400g meat, potatoes, veggies, 5 eggs. I would have to it eat everyday just to get to the 2000kcal a day. I'm starting to getting tired of it and also my poops got worse. I start to think it may be because of the meat because I eat almost same stuff everyday, but it's only high calorie stuff available (ground beef and ground pork shoulder).   
Butter (even ghee) is not an option.  
I am a simple man and like simple meals, I don't like overdoing and making some ""fancy"" meals with 10 ingredients. But I think I need a variation. Maybe I should just be pouring 50ml of olive oil in every meal, eh.   
I know nuts are high in calories, but I haven't been eating them for a long time and I am scared it will mess up my digestion even more.   
  
How do you guys do it? Eating 1-2 meals a day and getting up to 2000 kcal without ANY of the processed food.",1627997839

Paleo,Paleo influencers,"Just a few things that have been on my mind for a while….
When I first started eating paleo back around 2012 I looked to so many influencers on IG for advise, recipes, etc and found so many of them to be so helpful and really felt like I learned so much following them. But overtime I find there are less and less that I actually enjoy following. First of all so many seem to have turned away from paleo. And I don’t even mean just adding in dairy or white rice but they seem to not even like using the word paleo anymore which is fine like to each their own but it’s just something I’ve noticed and find odd. 
Second I find the space is just filled with wealthy privileged mostly white women trying so hard to seem relatable. I’ve had the displeasure of meeting one prominent person from the space in my personal life and she appears so different on social media than she is in real life that it makes me look at everyone a little differently and wonder how real or fake their personas are. The privilege that comes across is just so unappealing to me like those of us who aren’t privileged want to eat better and feel better too (if anyone knows any influencers that cater to that please lmk who they are) 
Lastly and I understand they need to make a living but the constant ads and selling their own products makes it so hard to enjoy or believe the content they share. Remember when vital proteins collagen was all anyone would talk about and then beauty counter 🙄 Diane Sanfilippo’s entire IG stories just seem like one big infomercial for her products (that combined with her attitude made her impossible for me to follow which is so sad cause in the past I had learned so much from her IG and podcast)
Who are some influencers you follow that still put out useful content? Is there anyone you stopped following and if so why?",1627837394

 anyone had similar experience?",1627819421
Paleo,"Weird question, but how can I eat less meat while still generally following a paleo diet?","I know this is the kind of the opposite of what this sub is all about, but maybe someone has some ideas. 

I don’t eat legumes or grains, except white rice and corn tortillas sometimes. I Do eat cheese, but know I’d be better off without it. I eat a lot of greens and vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts and baby carrots. I’ve never really liked mushrooms but I’m willing to give them a chance if I could learn a good way to cook them/enjoy them. 

I feel like I eat chicken all the damn time and I don’t need to. I eat beef 1-2 times a week and pork occasionally. I just want to eat less, but not be hungry. 

I don’t eat the meat substitutes like impossible burger meat or veggie burgers because they’re usually legume and grain based and sometimes the first ingredient is a terrible vegetable oil like soybean oil. I don’t want to start eating soy, though I’d be willing to eat tempeh if I could find it in stores and make it taste good. 

I also want to not be fully consumed by thinking about my diet and planning elaborate meals. I just want it to be relatively easy and not time super time consuming or labor intensive. When I switched to a paleo type whole 30 style diet, I’d read a lot about it and still agree that nutritionally, this makes sense for me. Other people choose veganism and that’s great, I just never see myself doing that. Vegetarian maybe eventually. 

Anyway, I want to consume less meat and contribute less to factory farming. Finding good sources of meat is a difficult/endeavor around here.

Has anyone felt similarly and backed off meat at all? What do you eat instead? I’m just looking for some ideas. Not to debate diet philosophies or anything.",1627748332
Paleo,Perspectives on raw honey and blackstrap molasses? conflicted [discussion],"I do my best to folliw a traditional foods diet, I don't usually use the word paleo but it seems to fit in the sub description. 

I dont eat cane sugar, consume foods with added sugars, or drink fruit juice because I want to avoid too much sugar. I do however eat raw honey and blackstrap molasses with some frequency. I heard raw honey could help support a healthy gut biome and I really struggle with gut health, so I've been eating a teaspoon or so nearly daily. I also have a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses in another food a few times a week because I read it is a good whole food iron supplement and I also used to have low iron. 

I have now been reading that some advise avoiding all sweeteners, even the more natural ones that have some minerals or nutritional benefit, because our bodies just don't need the sugar. I'm wondering what people on the sub think. How would you evaluate the cost-benefit of raw honey or blackstrap molasses?",1627745794

I roasted them and then put them in my crockpot for 22 hours on low with onion skins/ends, brocolli stalk, spices, and one steak bone from the dinner we had just eaten. 

I just took the broth off heat and tasted it and it is deep yellow and thick like olive oil. The bones still have a lot on them, so I'll probably use them again.

I went home and sat on the couch and then realized how different 'full' feels on a regular diet as opposed to a Paleo one.

Paleo,Is paleo a low-carb diet?,"From what I understand, paleo diet means eating what the caveman ate. But sometimes all what the caveman ate were fruits and vegetables. The fact that a caveman would eat meat if he found it, doesn't mean he was eating it everyday, because he might not find it in days or months. So all those percentages of how match carbs, fat, proteins that should be eaten on in a paleo diet on a daily basis don't make any sense to me. Because in the paleolithic era, there were no supermarkets where the caveman would choose what he would like to eat that day.  


This makes me question whether the paleo diet is necessarily a low-carb diet. Or it's just a diet where you're allowed to eat the food that was available 10.000 yrs ago, even if that food is mainly fruits and vegetables.

I also did a ton of drugs (not proud of it). I never really dealt with any digestive issues until a little over a year ago when I ate a 14 million scovile units peanut as a “challenge”. I ended up at the doctor with ulcers and a stomach hernia. Ever since then my stomach hasn’t really been the same, I managed to heal the ulcers but I still get weird sensations. To be honest it’s a lot better now, it’s very mild and according to my doctor it’s most likely IBS. I also been dealing with a lot of anxiety, and depression over the years. 

I really want to just start fresh, and start taking care of my body and mind. I have been Xanax daily for the last 4 months, I tried to quit cold turkey but 2 days in the withdrawals were so bad I had no choice but to get back on it. I could of resisted and rolled through it but the chances of having a seizure were high. So I am currently taking 2,5 MG per day. Prior to quitting I was on 3,5MG. I have no choice but to slowly taper down. 

I just started reading the GAPS book and I’m
Half way through and I really want to start the diet but I know that the Xanax messes with the gut flora and pretty much every cell in the body. Should I wait a couple of weeks and fully get off the Xanax before starting the diet, or the diet can actually help me get off the Xanax? 

Will it also help with the anxiety, and depression? Also inflammation? I noticed that I easily get tendinitis in my joints. Maybe my insides are also inflamed, who knows? I sent out a sample to get my gut biome tested, but I won’t get the results for a month or so.

Paleo,"As someone who got into Paleo because of a dairy intolerance, it's really weird seeing dairy added to every other recipe posted here.","Of course, Paleo is a flexible concept that can applied in various way. Correct is whatever works for each of us. That being said, context is still important. IMHO it's a bad idea to have cheese or milk added to a ""Paleo"" dish without even mentioning possible substitutions or that covering your gluten free pizza with cheese is not strictly Paleo.

I have a milk protein intolerance. Joint pain, stiff fingers in the morning, itching blisters on hands and feet. I can consume lactose just fine, even had it tested. When I started experimenting with my diet I eventually ended up with Paleo. Removing dairy does wonders for me and lowering my bread consumption makes me feel less like a balloon and more like a human. 

If at the beginning of my journey I had found Paleo via this sub I would probably have ended up trying one of the recipes with dairy. Symptoms wouldn't have improved and I would have dismissed Paleo as not the right thing for me. So, when posting recipes with dairy please make it clear that this might not be the right thing for everyone and that diary is not part of a strict Paleo diet. Maybe consider discussing alternatives or leaving it out completely. Posting recipes with dairy is just fine, we all work differently, but exactly because of that one should make it clear that the cheese in your gluten free pizza might be a problem that Paleo can solve.",1626606191

Paleo,putting on weight,"Hey All,
   I'm looking for suggestions on what can be done in a healthy way to put on weight. Ive always been a skinny dude (60ish kg), i can basically eat large amounts of food for months on end and never put on weight, it actually sucks. i went *mostly* paleo for digestive issues a few years back (cant do beans,legumes, grains, dairy etc). and i do like my energy levels and mental health more since eating well. Anyway i dont exercise heaps (Pilates 2 times a week and maybe 1x  8k hike). 
anyway below is one day of eating habits for example-

breakfast 9am - chopped kale, celery, apple, lemon, Carrot, goji berries, protein powder, cricket powder, collagen, avo, olive oil.
decaf coffee +coconut milk

lunch 1pm ish - root vegetables and protein (chicken or fish or cow or pig or roo) 

dinner 7 pm ish - slaw &amp; broccolini (coconut oil) + collagen, salmon, gf garlic bread.

im actually mostly still hungry after dinner most nights unless i have a large steak and lots of sweet potato.

snacks - yesterday was kale chips and some frozen roasted sweet potato, seaweed, protein bar (paleo one).

i went on a holiday recently and are processed shit food for 11 days as i was living out of a campvan with no fridges (was at a festival) and didn't put on any weight. no Matter how much i eat i cant put on weight (even if i eat stupid high amount of food past the ""im full point"" which i tried once.). i want to do fasting sometimes for health benefits but cant because of my weight is too low.


TLDR - what can i do to put on weight while also being healthy?",1626305905

Paleo,New for me Beef and Vegetables recipe,"Yesterday I was too tired to cook anything complex so just made this recipe up as I went. It turned out really tasty. Husband and I had it for last night's dinner and today's lunch.

Zucchini - 2
Mushrooms - 2 cups
Coconut Aminos - 1 tablespoon
Olive Oil - 1 tablespoon divided
Maple Syrup - to taste ( optional)
Celery Salt - 1/4 teaspoon
Salt and pepper to taste

Paleo,What I've learned after 8 years of Paleo,"Started Paleo when I was 17 and have been doing it on and off for the past eight years.  

**1)** Like with any diet, you need a fitness/diet app. No not to be used as a calorie counting app, but an app that tells you your macronutrients (**please hear me out!** macros used to overwhelm me but with an app there's no measuring, calculating, or guessing for you to have to do at all). On average it's suggested people eat 50% carbs / 30% fat / 20% protein. On the Paleo diet it is best to go with the ratio 30% carbs / 40% fat / 30% protein. I use MyFitnessPal. It's free, and all of the food you need to track has already been entered and saved by other users. This is important, and the app does all the math for you, just search and add the food. Now I know things like...  

* a Cashew Cookie Lara Bar is 44% carbs / 47% fat / 9% protein  
* an egg is 2% carbs / 62% fat / 36% protein  
* a cup of almond milk is 13% carbs / 74% fat / 13% protein  

**2)** Dairy is up to you, if you find it works for you it works for you, if it doesn't work then it doesn't. The only dairy I consume is grass-fed butter and whey protein powder. No cheese, milk, yogurt, or sour cream in my diet. But if you feel food and look good eating dairy, go for it.  

**3)** A serving of meat is 1/2 a cup. A Little bit of meat goes a long way. 1/2 a cup of chicken or ground turkey doesn't look like a lot, but it is.  

**4)** A serving of nuts is 1/3 cup. It's easy to sit there and eat a ton of almonds and cashews, but if you don't measure out something like 26 nuts you're overeating. 26 is also a lot more than you think.  

**5)** Stop eating lettuce. It has 0 calories and no nutritional benefits. Switch to either kale or spinach. They both taste better than lettuce anyway and have so many more nutritional benefits. If you're eating romaine lettuce you're wasting your time and money.  

**6)** Have fun with substitutes! There are tons of other (although more expensive) ways to enjoy your favorite foods on the Paleo diet. I love Doritos, can't eat Doritos, so instead I buy grain and dairy free Paleo Puffs or Siete chips (this brand also makes almond flour tortillas you can use for dinner or breakfast tacos). Can't eat Betty Crocker's brownies, so I buy a brand instead called Simple Mills that makes almond flour brownies. I eat two of those brownies basically every single day on my diet. Craving pasta? A brand called Capellos makes almond flour pasta, and Primal Kitchen makes a dairy free alfredo sauce, as well as several other awesome dressings. I don't eat these every day, but it's fun to try out Paleo cereals, chips, baked goods, gummies, ice cream, candy bars, pastas, etc.  

**7)** Watch out for vegetable/canola oil. All companies use these oils because it's cheaper, but it's not Paleo. I hate to see people on Paleo enjoying Blue Diamonds ""Lightly Salted"" or ""Smokehouse"" almonds. They literally fry those almonds in vegetable oil, it's not as healthy as you think. Or when people buy frozen pre-made sweet potato fries or fish (I'm victim to purchasing the frozen fish brand Sea Cuisine for years, it's not Paleo, it's highly processed, and is made with non-Paleo oils). Look at that nutrition label, they are always made using vegetable oil. Yes fish and sweet potatoes are Paleo, but not when they are fried in non Paleo oils. Only consume olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil, those are literally just about your only three options.  

**8)** Don't eat any foods that aren't Paleo. Not because of some dumb rule, but because if you are on this diet and you find it hard to lose weight, it's for a reason. You're probably intolerant to one of the following: grains, dairy, gluten, soy, legumes, sugar. If you include any food that is non-Paleo it will effect your overall progress. If you think you're doing Paleo right, then come to realize from this post maybe some of the foods you're eating actually have non-Paleo ingredients, I encourage you to do it for real for a week and you will see better results and feel amazing.  

**9)** Protein supplements are in my opinion completely necessary, especially if you are trying to both lose weight and gain muscle. I eat a decent amount of meats and eggs, and it's still not enough for me to reach my daily diet goal of 30% protein. The Paleo diet (at least Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint) also mandates exercise in the Paleo lifestyle. I use 100% Whey Protein from Optimum Nutrition (whey is dairy mind you). I drink it every day, but on days you workout you must drink it within 30 minutes of ending the workout (I also used to totally make fun of the bros who drank protein powder...until I realized how important and healthy it is for your muscles; it's not all about the looks, it's about health and recovery too). Also you don't need a gym or a trainer unless you want one. But if you're clueless about exercise, you'll need someone to help. I find DVD workout programs to be best because there's minimal equipment, a trainer to teach you form and give you a complete workout to do, and they are relatively cheap programs, like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/RIPT90-Exercise-Training-Calendar-Nutrition/dp/B00SJPA7SS) I'm doing now for $45.  

**10)** Have the mindset of ""I want to feel good"" not ""I want to look good"". If you have an intolerance to grains, dairy, gluten, sugar, soy, or legumes, and you actually take those things out of your diet, you will feel amazing. FYI humans have been eating fruits, vegetables, meat, nuts, and eggs for over 300,000 years...bread was invented 10,000 years ago. Some foods are really not supposed to be in our diet. And don't be jealous of the skinny guy who can eat 4,000 calories of bread every day and never gain a pound, don't be jealous of the people who were born with a six pack because their parents have good genes. Work with what you got. My family history on my dads side is high blood pressure, lung cancer, and ulcers and my moms side is diabetes, stroke, obesity, and high blood pressure, then they created a whole new kind of messed up genetic nightmare in me. The only way to make things right in my world is the Paleo diet. I can't eat rice, I can't eat peanuts. It's not how my body works. And if you're here because you have a hard time losing weight, you might be in the same boat. Stick it to the companies and society that wants you addicted to their high calorie, processed, oily sugary, cancer causing foods.  

My daily diet plan, roughly:  

Breakfast: 

* Cashew Cookie Lara Bar with a tbsp of Justin's ORIGINAL almond butter (don't buy anything vanilla, maple, hazelnut, chocolate flavored because it's just a ton of added sugar.)  
* an apple  
* 2 Simple Mills almond flour brownies  
* Two cups of coffee sweetened with almond milk  

Lunch:  

* Usually a breakfast taco using one almond flour tortilla from the Siete brand (find this in the frozen bread section at your grocery store), three scrambled eggs, half a cup of turkey sausage, 1 tbsp of Primal Kitchen Ranch (find this in the condiment aisle), Frank's hot sauce, lime juice, and finely chopped kale.  
   * Make your own ground turkey/ground sausage. I'm a victim to buying Jimmy Dean's turkey sausage patties for years. It's processed, who knows what is in there. Also Jimmy Dean is owned by Tyson which is disgusting). I just buy a ""simple/organic truth"" brand and cook and season it myself. Tastes 100x better, Jimmy Dean tastes like rubber now.  

Dinner:  

* 2 cups of chopped kale or spinach  
* 1/2 cup of either fish, ground turkey, or chicken that I made (just look up some recipes, I love baked chicken or fish recipes made in the oven because it's less work then doing it stovetop)  
* 1 cup of roasted sweet potatoes (don't be like how I was and buy those frozen Alexia sweet potato fries. Learn how to chop up sweet potatoes, drench that in olive oil and spices and bake it. Tastes great and you can eat more (12 Alexia sweet potato fries = 140 calories...a whole sweet potato = 112).  
* 1 - 2 tbsp of Primal Kitchen Ranch  

Snacks:

* 1 serving of either raw almonds or cashews (about 26).  
* Protein smoothie: 2 cups of frozen berries, 1 cup of UNSWEETENED almond milk, 2 scoops of vanilla 100% whey protein powder, 1 tbsp of almond butter (consume immediately after if working out that day.  
* 1 serving (15 chips) Siete Jalapeno Lime chips.
* 350mL (1/2 a bottle) of red wine, lol
* 1 tbsp olive oil (an assumption based on the foods I cooked and made myself (ie roasted sweet potatoes, chicken, turkey sausage, etc.  

Based on my height, weight, and goals I'm expected to eat 2,500 calories a day according to My Fitness Pal, 3,000 calories if I workout.  

The above diet plan comes out to a surprising 3,200 calories according to my app. If I wasn't working out this day I would probably remove the almond butter, brownies, tortilla chips, and/or wine.  

I hope that any of this helps! It's a learning process for sure, it's taken me a long time to know what I know today, and I still have so much more to learn. Make it fun! It's a challenge but it's definitely doable! Just know you get to eat a lot more than you think, and there are so many fun substitutes for cereal, chips, pasta, baked goods, etc.  Good luck!",1626281581

I have some GI issues, including gastritis, bloating, etc, so lately I've been on a pretty strict diet so I could eat foods then were easier for me to digest. Apart from some grains (not truly paleo, I know) and cooked vegetables, I relied heavily upon bananas, potatoes, and avocados, all of which are very high in potassium. And I mean like 3-4 bananas a day, 1 avocado split between meals, and a couple of potato pancakes at almost every meal. Not long ago I started waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, and that frequent urination continued till early morning. The urine was colorless and there was a lot of it :) The issue was less apparent on hot days when I was exercising and sweating a lot.

Yesterday I did a blood test, which revealed I had high potassium (5.3, normal range 3.6-5.1), whereas my sodium level was normal (140). Will need to talk to my doctor, of course.

I had to break ketosis and I’m probably not going to want to stay on keto for the foreseeable future, but I’m not seeing anything about the macros for Paleo. 

And from what I’m understanding, Paleo is still mostly Fat &gt; Pro &gt; Carb? Or does protein matter more than fat? 

For me, my Keto macros were: 
70 Fat/ 25 Pro/ 5 Carb

So could I follow a similar macro for Paleo but eat enough carbs to stay out of ketosis? Or is there a a specific threshold for carbs to not pass?

I literally started crying trying to eat it for lunch just now because I couldn’t &amp; I know I need to for my health.

The markers out of ranger were a high fasting glucose of 108, my total cholesterol was 223, My HDL was 61, and my LDL was a high 145.

What could be causing this? Is there any realistic way to lower this so my doctor doesn’t become alarmed?",1625067488

Paleo,Question on Coconut Sugar,"I recently started Paleo again and I noticed that a lot of dessert recipes now call for coconut sugar. Back in 2018 when I first did Paleo, desserts that required a sweetener used (minimal) honey / maple syrup or had a clever approach to have no sweeteners (blending in fruit for example).

With that being said, my understanding is, to get the most out of Paleo to lose weight, swapping out white sugar for coconut sugar will basically put me on the road to maintain my current weight.

Am I interpreting the Paleo diet properly? Should I try to avoid coconut sugar and embrace minimal amounts of maple syrup/honey to lose weight or is coconut sugar a safe ingredient to consume for weight loss?",1624654994

Paleo,Im having trouble getting ripped. Would paleo help?,"Its been 4-5 months and my physique still sucks. I think Im either eating too much carbs, too much processed food, or not enough protein. 

See, I have been gradually decreasing my calories every month while still training. 

Not gonna lie, i have a sweet tooth. I eat candy in small amounts here and there. Sometimes ill eat some snack chips. I have a cheat meal once a week. 


I'm 6'2. 200 pounds. I've tried a lot of different things lately on trying to get ripped. I've cut calories dramatically, and it's been about 4 months. I have lost some body fat, but my body still looks like shit TBH. I have no muscularity or definition. My body is still ""soft.""

I do have cheat meals once a weak. I do eat basically, carbs, and sometimes processed food. So I can attribute some of it to that. But the ""main"" part of my diet comes around to ..
Sample of my diet:

Fruit smoothie / acai bowl in morning.
Light protein bar
Potatoes / Beef / Meat.
Total Calories: 1500.
For a 6'2 - 200 pound guy, 1500 calories is way too little. (I understand.) - But it was a gradual decrease. I was cutting little by little. To be honest, in this entire time, I probably lost equal amounts of muscle or fat. My physique kinda looks like I'm retaining water. 

I know it's the carbs / procesed food in my diet, (I think) - I know I'm not eating enough lean meat. My diet is really 100% clean. I'm trying to clean it up. 

On top of that, to be honest, with such a low defecit, and the content of my calories, I do feel like shit a lot. Low energy, weak. 

At least if I had the ripped physique I Could say it's for a reason.

I need to clean up my diet. Im wondering if I should eliminate rice / breads .. or just keep the diet clean. Advice?

 But I have not developed any vascularity or ""ripped"" ness at all in the past 4-5 months.

I stopped tanning since and have tried Keto, even did carnivore for 8 weeks and 0 luck.

Paleo,Pumpkin seeds - hard to digest,"Hi everyone! I always assumed that it was nuts that were usually giving people a hard time when it came to digestion (myself included), while seeds should be somewhat better. However, I've been noticing that pumpkin seeds (without shells) are very hard on my digestion. They almost immediately cause bloating, fatigue, and the overall sense that the food eaten along with them is just sitting there in the stomach for a very long time. Tried to soak them overnight, it didn't change much. The same is true for sunflower seeds, by the way, and almost any nut. Does anyone follow a healthy diet without nuts and/or seeds?

Paleo,Meat quality,"Has anyone noticed a difference in the quality of the meat they purchase? I like to buy raw meat and cook it myself, usually with little to no additional processing. I have found that I just can't stomach a lot of poultry unless I buy from higher-quality sources. I tried, because I don't have that kind of income, but I just can't eat it. It upsets my stomach and smells bad to me. So I buy upper-end, ""organic"" or expensive small farm chicken... or no chicken.   
For a while I felt like I was being overly sensitive... has anyone else noticed this? It really put me off from having poultry in my diet for a long, long time. I have a similar thing with eggs too. I grew up with chickens and for whatever reason the smell of poor quality chicken products makes me feel sick; maybe it's because I attuned somehow to the free-range chicken smell? My doctor thinks I'm being overly dramatic or OCD but I almost wonder if I'm sensitive to some aspect or product used in cheap bulk farming of poultry. Doesn't happen to me with beef/pork. I need higher protein in my diet and I get tired of tuna. I don't really like to support animal farming anymore anyway, but it's hard to get desirable amounts of animal protein since plant protein is hard for me to digest it seems.",1623780323

Paleo,"Elimination diet for pelvic pain, constipation","Hey all. Hopefully this a suitable sub for this post.

A few days ago I started a strict elimination diet. Have only been eating beef, chicken, eggs, broccoli and cabbage.

I am trying this to see if it helps with my pelvic pain and bladder issues (M28), which have been a nightmare for the past 8 months or so. Not common food intolerance symptoms, but some people with similar symptoms find relief with dietary changes. Early signs are extremely positive, like I feel normal - better than any meds I've taken (physical therapy has been another thing to really help). Quite amazed tbh.

I have already been gluten free and milk free for a few months, so neither of these were the sole culprits.

I've now gone three days without a bowel movement. Is this normal? Or at least when adjusting? Normally I go once per day. Is there anything I can be doing to help with this? I'm supplementing vit D, magnesium glycinate and probiotics, and I'm also taking a daily low dose of tadalafil, which is known to help pelvic pain and bladder issues. Also, prior to these three days I did a 36 hour water-fast. I'm drinking a lot of water and I'm going to start on bone broth very soon. Constipation is well known for exacerbating pelvic pain, so I'm a bit worried, though right now I feel fine. 

I'm also urinating a lot less frequently, but I was going too much before as a result of the bladder trouble.

Paleo,180 lb weight loss. Here's what worked for me and what didnt.," 

I made myself pretty sick listening to the typical weight loss advice so I'm writing this post to tell everyone what worked, what didn't and why. Along with some advice.

1. See your doctor and get a health profile first. If I had done this, I would have known I had low blood pressure. I therefore would not have listened to people who told me to reduce my salt intake and drink only water. I almost died so, take it from me: reducing salt with low BP is... not awesome.
2. Self test for food allergies. Method 1: Treat yourself like a baby, start with easy to process foods and add back one food a week. Reduce or eliminate foods that give you stomach pain, bloating, or an allergic reaction. Method 2: Every week (or 2 weeks), eliminate a food or food type. Look for for reduced bloating or weight loss, and look for stomach pain etc when you add it back. That's how I found out I was allergic to wheat. And why I got tested for celiac. I lost a TON of the weight just from stopping the allergic reactions.
3. Don't guzzle drinks. If you're so thirsty you need to knock back an entire bottle of water, you're too thirsy. Drinking that fast causes stomach pain, which in turn makes you want to avoid water. Drink lots throughout the day to stay hydrated.
4. Drinks aren't food lubricant. Your body is mostly water, and it needs water more often than most people drink it. If you're just having a glass (or a liter, hello McDonald's cup) of liquid with every meal, you're not drinking enough (or in the case of a big takeout cup, you're drinking too much)
5. Avoid high fructose corn syrup. That's all I have to say about that.
6. Avoid artificial sweeteners. They tend to taste sweeter than sugar and you can accidentally normalize sugar to your system.
7. Reset your tastebuds. Do a detox. I drank nothing but black tea and water for 3 days to cleanse my system and my palate. Most of us are way too used to extremely high sugar content in food. Because of that, we think foods like fruit are extremely bland. Once you reset your palate you can easily develop a normal relationship with sugar. Things like apples and strawberries will taste as sweet as cakes and pies. You'll eat less junk without even thinking about it.
8. Choose snacks by texture. Train your brain to say ""I want chips... I want something crunchy... I want carrot sticks"" ""I want chocolate... I want something smooth and sweet... I want blueberries""
9. Eat lots of soup.
10. Don't over eat Fibre or foods your body can't process. This was one of my worst mistakes. I spent more time on the toilet... it was bad. A lot of diets are going to tell you to mainline lettuce or peas, or just go feral on corn. If you do... You're going to poop a lot. Now granted, the average person has about 3-8 lbs of poop in their intestine. And granted, you can get a lot of reading done on the toilet, but you've got places to be. Things to do. You need to live!
11. Don't eat useless greens. Is my hatred for lettuce showing? Look, the world is full of lettuces. You've got spinach, which gives you an iron boost. Kale and bok choy, the nutrient powerhouses. Collard greens and Swiss chard, those love muffins of magnesium and calcium and potassium. Lettuce is like... Solid water with Metamucil mixed in. Stick some Swiss chard on your burger. Fry up some collards or bok. Live a little.
12. Nothing green has any calories. Except avocadoes. Avocadoes have a million calories and a zillion grams of fat and taste like troll snot, except in guacamole. Mint chip ice cream has no calories however, because it is green. Fite me.
13. Drink. But don't DAH-RINK. A glass of wine or a few cocktails can relax you after a long day, and reduced stress is a good thing. Some alcohol has positive effects: red wine has antioxidants, vodka sterilizes, bourbon can alleviate cold symptoms. And most alcohol loosens your joints which is good for ongoing health and probably why your alcoholic granny lived to be 97 BUT drinking too much fills you with extra calories and lowers your inhibitions. Or, as my forever tipsy prof once put it: ""for every one drink you think you drunk, you drank 3 drinks you didn't think you drunk, and that's why you don't think you drunk.""
14. Smoking is bad for your cardio. So is air pollution. I don't smoke, and I lost 40 of those pounds by moving out of a place where I lived with a smoker and into a town with better air quality. I started swimming or running at the gym instead of outside. Basically, if you cant breathe, your workouts will be shorter, because you need oxygen to survive.
15. Sports. Basically, swimming for an hour burns 400 ish calories. Running burns 300 or so. But swimming lengths or running in circles for 60 full minutes is boring, painful, and misery making. Some people love running, I'm sure they exist. Great for them. I hate running. But can I run for an hour during a 2 hour game of baseball or soccer? How many times do I squat during a volleyball game? And how many tricep pullbacks do I do on a leisurely canoe trip across the lake? I'm not counting... And I'm doing more than I would have just staring at a wall watching it.... wall, or whatever.
16. Do it now. Don't waste time on ""I wish I could"" Wish you could go to the beach? Go. Wish you could wear a crop top? Do. I had an irrational fear that everyone would hate, scream at, and make fun of me. OK not completely irrational. That's what they did in high school. And some high school kids did it when I started just wearing the bikini as an adult. But a lot more people complimented me, or didn't notice at all. I was just a person. Not a big old ugly spectacle with a neon ""hate me"" sign taped to my forehead.
17. Don't catfish. Put your whole self on your profiles. Not close ups of your face. Get professional photos taken in an outfit you absolutely love, and own it.
18. Take care of yourself now. ""I'll get my hair cut when I'm skinny."" ""I'll buy new clothes when I'm skinny"" ""I'll love myself when I'm skinny."" get the haircut now.
19. Dab on the haters. Or do some other, similarly weird as hell gesture. When people made fun of me, I would sprinkle glitter on them. ""Every time it rains glitter on an asshole, somewhere, a fairy gets its wings"" The looks on their faces were honestly priceless. They'd either look shocked, get angry, or laugh and think I'm awesome. Either way I won. Full disclosure: someone did try to punch me once. That day, I was pretty glad for all the cardio.
20. Sleep is very important. That's what I want you to tell people when they catch you passing out after your yoga stretch routine at the park. Don't forget to thank them for the coffee money.

I hope this helped anyone!",1623206755

Paleo,A 370 poind male just diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes looking into a Paleo style diet,"Okay so let me begin with myself and my eating style.

I am what you call a depression induced stress eater, I eat a lot of food until I feel am full.

I am very sedentary and dont really like going outside that much.

Now the good news is that over the last 6 years I did change some eating habits like cut back on the pasta and sweets though I would still eat breads and rice now and then.

I have always had a weight issue though but this year its come to this.

Thanks to 2020 being crap with me eating what I had to ignoring all health risks I balooned a lot and now been diagnosed with diabetes.

And its not thanks to me eating lots of sweets, my sugars more come from me eating bagles and bread with the occasional pasta dish.

But still I gotta do something now as my doctor reccomended a diet due to my diabetic status.

But if I must diet I want to choose a diet that even if things go crazy again I can still mostly attain to without it being an issue and am chosing the paleo diet as my base.

I chose it as its the diet I feel I can work with, I already eat a lot of meats and the fruits and veggies Paleo have in it are what I like so going onto the paleo diet does not bother me.

However I may have to break a few rules now and then.

Like having corn on the cob now and then or eating chili with beans and meat.

And sometimes I just dont feel like cooking or am away from home and go out to eat now and then.

And yes this does mean eating something with potatos too, sometimes the only side some restauraunts have are potatoes, apple sauce, rice, corn and cole slaw and I really really dislike cole slaw and apple sauce so theres that.

In any case I will try to stay in the limits of the diet to the best of my abilites, but if anyone has tips on if i say eat out somewhere I can seee if i can order what is best for me without to resorting to a salad as some places love putting stuff I hate on salads such as raw onions and nearly every time i say hold the onions its like I am speaking klingon or something.

Anyhow sorry for the ramble there at the end but i am sure some of you can relate :D

I hope to hear from you guys though, I already got started thanks tgo my sister who while being on the Keto diet knows quite a bit about the paleo diet too, she is not a dietician mind you but my sister is very goot about knowing about diets and will be my rock during this time until I get used to this new diet.",1622492250
Paleo,"Do you work an office job? How do you incorporate ""play"" as exercise?","Mark Sisson insists that [play is an essential part of a primal lifestyle](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-definitive-guide-to-play/), and lots of other paleo influencers have said similar things. Exercise should be FUN. It shouldn't be something have to motivate yourself to do. 

I'll admit that I have some post-honeymoon blues. My husband and I went to Hawaii for two weeks and I got at least an hour (thanks Fitbit) of high heart rate activity *daily* without even thinking about it. Swimming in the ocean. Surfing. Hiking. Frisbee. The list goes on. 

I think, for the first time since I was a kid, I really *understand* play as an adult. I had no workouts, but I did have days out. 

Of course, I, like most people, can't afford to be on vacation all the time. I'm back at my office job locked inside all day and four hours away from the nearest beach. Humans are definitely not meant to live in cubicles.

I'm eyeing my prior running and lifting schedule and seeing them as chores. Not paleo at all. Definitely not motivational. Lifting isn't even outside. 

How the heck do you guys get playtime in *daily*? What do you do for yourself? Or are you more of a weekend warrior (at least we have day trips to go hiking?).",1622479571

Does it really help with teeth?,"I had at least 3 years to go to dentist for a normal cleaning ( i never do teeth whitening) and my teeth became really white ( like they used to be some years before). And i wonder if regular cod liver oil helped my teeth cause i did not changed anything. I was also drinking for 1 month water with 1 tablespoon of aple cider vinegar but with a straw. I cannot think of anything else that may helped.

Also is Fermented Cod Liver Oil better than the regular or worse? I read that i has less free radicals and it does not expires.",1620704799

Paleo,Stainless Steel Pan for Paleo Pancakes/Crepes?,"I love making things like paleo pancakes, crepes, tortillas on the weekends for brunch, but I've been making these in a cheap traditional teflon pan. I've decided to ditch the super toxic cookware and switch to stainless steel pans. 

The problem with stainless steel is that it sticks!! I know that with proper techniques it's easy to make traditional pancakes and crepes in stainless but wheat flour also works very differently from coconut/almonds/cassava flours. I'm kind of afraid to try and waste a bunch of ingredients (these nut flours aren't cheap!) A cast iron would be my first go to, but I have a glass stove top so it's probably not a good idea to use a cast iron skillet on my stove. 

Anyone make their paleo brunches in stainless steel with luck? What type of pans are recommended?",1620657444

Paleo,[Question] Incorporating beef (mainly chuck steaks) into my already mostly paleo diet has greatly improved my energy levels and quality of life. Any ideas regarding the science behind this?,"Hello,

(29, M, very fit and active) 

I am really puzzled by this. Historically, I have always been very fit and active (I used to be a wrestler and still do my wrestling workouts 4-6x/wk) and have followed a mostly paleo diet. To this day, I have not changed my exercise routine and am still very fit.

I recently graduated veterinary school, during which I suffered random bouts of fatigue, erectile dysfunction, low libido, and slightly low testosterone (diagnosed). My basic bloodwork never showed any vitamin or mineral deficiencies (though, the tests weren't comprehensive). My diet mainly consisted of chicken, potatoes, oatmeal, some fruits and veggies, but never any beef (due to chicken being so much cheaper, and I was a poor vet student).

Now, I am out in the world and working. Maybe eight weeks ago, I started to buy chuck steaks, slow cook them with some spices and tomato sauce, and have some beef for dinner each night.

**My life has been a 180 since then, in a positive way.** 

I have more energy. I am sleeping better. My libido has improved, and I have weaned myself off my low dose of testosterone (have not taken any in three weeks now, and am not going back). Nothing else in my life (diet, emotional, routine, etc.) has changed-- just the addition of beef.

So...does anyone have any ideas about why incorporating beef into my diet has impacted my body in such a positive way? Could it contain some vitamins/minerals that I was previously not consuming enough of? Maybe my body just accepts its protein better than it does with other meats?

I am really confused but also ecstatic that I am feeling so much better and energetic about myself and life.

If anyone replies, thanks in advance!

TLDR: Why does eating BEEF, compared to chicken/pork, make me feel great/like a normal human again??

EDIT: Thanks for all of the answers. Seems like there can be several different reasons behind this. I appreciate all of the insight!",1619987487

Late last year I became a Certified GAPS Practitioner. This training was the culmination of my decade long education in nutrition and holistic health. I am so excited to share with the world everything I’ve learned and to kick it off I’m hosting a 1-hour Free Online Masterclass this Saturday to give a brief introduction into the transformative and healing world of GAPS and the importance of you Gut Health.  


GAPS (Gut and Psychology/Physiology Syndrome) is a nutrition healing protocol that restores healthy gut flora to optimize function in the brain and body. No matter the chronic symptoms you live with, the state of your gut flora impacts or causes those symptoms!  


I will show you how to master the rhythm of the kitchen: the foods to eat, the foods to avoid, how to organize your kitchen and life around nourishing disease-healing foods, and help you build a renewed relationship between food, your body, and our Earth.",1619805813

2. With what type of physical exercise can fat oxidation be achieved?
3. What   is more ""stressful"" for the body; alternating between periods of eating   and fasting (intermittent fasting - time restricted eating) or the constant increase in blood glucose due to frequent   food intakes during the day ?
4. Carbohydrates,   proteins, fats and fibers; Could you please sort them according to   level of satiety and how fast they rise glucose level?  What about   macros  slowing down sugar absorption?
5. Sometimes,   spacing meals out gets complicated; specially during unplanned social   events / gatherings / friends? Is it really that bad not to wait 3  hours  between meal ( assuming one eats healthy and respects  total  daily  calories? )  From time to time  I have to break this structure  and eat  for example every two hours and I feel a little guilty!

Paleo,question for those of you who track your macros,"I am a diet nut. I did strict paleo for a couple of years and then did strict zero carb (carnivore) for more than a year. While paleo made me feel great, carnivore got rid of all my joint aches and food cravings. I just felt good physically and had a super clear and steady mind. Since then I have strayed back to paleo and have noticed a few things. some of my psoriasis comes back (very mild). Also my mood is noticeably more happy. I'm not unhappy on carnivore but there is definitely a difference. I've been tracking my diet with Cronometer and my paleo macros add up to 54% fat, 23% protein, and 23% carbs with an average of 100 carbs per day. I suspect that the carbs have an effect on serotonin.

Have any of you noticed this type of mental change when changing your carb ratio? What ratios give you the best all around feeling?",1617553766

Paleo,Cheat Day Followed by 48hr Fast,"I’m curious what the effects of a cheat day on a carnivore diet might be and how a 48 hour fast immediately following might mitigate any harm done by the cheat day. 
I plan to do the carnivore diet 5 days a week with a 4 hour eating window. I usually eat pork rinds, 2 lbs of beef, beef liver supplements, and kefir. On the sixth day I would allow myself a large cheat meal still keeping it relatively paleo/keto. And on the seventh day I simply wouldn’t eat (I’ve done multiple day fasts in the past).
I don’t struggle with weight and I workout very regularly. I’m a fit 24yo male for reference. This wouldn’t be a binge eating day, more like a treat meal, a day where I can go out to eat with friends. 
I’m more interested in the effects a cheat day like this would affect the metabolism, digestive system, immune system, etc. while eating carnivore otherwise, and also whether or not fasting afterward would ease these effects. For example, I know introducing carbs into your diet can cause constipation, but since they’re the last thing going in, followed by a fast, is it really such a problem? Any thoughts on that or anything else would be appreciated!

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In this major synthesis of cross-cultural research, 34 distinguished scientists study 25 common metabolic and degenerative diseases characteristic of all advanced Western nations and then examine their incidence in developing countries, among both hunter-gatherers and peasant agriculturalists. Thus the authors provide a unique opportunity to compare epidemiological data reflecting modern modes of life with data influenced by habits and diets dating back 400 generations to the advent of agriculture, and even 200,000 generations or more to the dawn of man.
&gt; 
&gt; The results confirm the view that diseases like hypertension, lung cancer, diverticular disease, and appendicitis are maladaptations to environmental factors introduced since the Industrial Revolution. They also demonstrate that such diseases become more prevalent when Western lifestyles are adopted in primitive societies. Certain studies reveal a regression of disease incidence when exercise is increased and a diet high in starch and fiber, low in fat and salt, is resumed—characteristics of a simpler way of life. _Western Diseases_ greatly broadens our perspective on some of the most vexing health problems in our society. It will be an essential reference for epidemiologists, nutritionists, and gastroenterologists in particular.

Paleo,FASTEST WAY TO ABS: Short 3 Step Guide," 

# Introduction

The trick to lose weight, in my humble opinion, has a lot to do with carefully picking what you’re eating and keeping track of your **calories and macronutrients**. It takes a bit of effort to understand the logic behind it but one thing I’m sure of is that, once grasped, it **works 100%**.

# 1. Calories Deficit

To start with, we must highlight the fact that in order to lose weight, be it belly fat, double chin, fats in your legs, whatever - they all have the same molecular structure: **adipose tissue** \- there must be a **caloric deficit of 500 calories maximum**. If you go beyond that, you would start feeling less energetic and have some undesirable unintended effects.

The science behind this is that your body has a Basal Metabolic Rate (i.e how many calories it needs to be optimally functioning and going) that is determined by how heavy you are, male or female, tall, old, and active at day - to - day basis. Under the right conditions (more on this later), if you give your body 500 calories less than its BMR, it will start burning fat or energy to compensate for those 500 calories. And that’s how, gentlemen and lurking ladies, you lose weight.

But that’s oversimplified. **Because what you eat is what determines the “right conditions”** for your body to start running on your fat tissue.

# 2. Rest days/Workout days

The second thing to bear in mind is to divide your days into 2 types:

Workout days and resting days. For each type of day, you’ll eat the same amount of calories in deficit. What changes, though, is the percentages of where you’re getting your calories from.

* **Resting days**: This might sound contradictory to some people, but on the resting days, you should get all of your calories (preferably) from fats.

Fats are scientifically proven to improve the process of ketosis/gluconeogenesis and keeps you satiated for a longer period of time than carbs or proteins.

In the following paragraph you will find a short description of the biochemistry behind fats contributing in weight loss.

The monomer that your body uses/burns to keep it’s cells alive is glucose. Foods high on carbs are high on glucose. Fats do not contain glucose. So when you eat fats, they do not get metabolized for energy. They get stored as triglycerides (the actual fat tissue). No questions asked. But here's the rub: since you’re not giving your body carbs or proteins to take energy from, your body will be breaking down the adipose tissue, forming glucose out of it, to keep on going. It'll effectively break down the triglycerides into glycerol and free fat acids and transform them in the liver glucose or ketone bodies in case glucagon levers are significantly higher than insulin, which brings us to the next point.

Fats do not cause insulin release from the pancreas. When insulin is released, it primes your body to draw energy from the food **absorbed during digestion**.

Insulin is released in great amounts when you consume carbs because carbs are directly digested into glucose. Glucose enters the body through glut proteins in your cells, and these glut proteins only work when insulin is bound to them (most of them).

So the trick is to eat fats in deficit. When you do that, the fats stored will be less than the ones burnt. Your body is indeed storing and burning fats at the same time. And furthermore, when you keep eating only fats, **glucagon levels** will eventually arise and will initiate gluconeogenesis (the process of creating glucose from TRG in the liver) and in longer periods of doing this, ketogenesis. 

So when you only eat fats, you decrease the amount of insulin released, increase the glucagon, and force your body to run on your fat tissue. **But what to eat, that’s the question**. So I will give a list of the stuff I’m eating, maybe it can help you:

* Bulletproof Coffee: coconut oil (20g) + grass-fed butter (20g)
* Omelette (3 eggs) with cheese (30g) fried in coconut oil with fats remaining from bacon (60-80g)
* 3 boiled eggs
* Peanuts/almonds/hazelnuts (50g)
* Sometimes I eat 100g of chicken breasts or turkey.

All of these add up approximately to 1500 calories. If your BDM is 2000. That is 500 calories deficit. Done and dusted.

* **Workout days**: On your workout days, you should not workout after a meal. You should workout **fasting** (a) and (b) you should do **cardio**. It doesn’t matter how you do it: running on the treadmill, burpees, running outside, walking. Just get your ass moving. And after you finish, then you eat.

The point of this is to run on your stored glycogen and once depleted, your body will switch to the adipose tissue again and cause weight loss. The difference between the workout and resting days is where you get your calories from as I mentioned in the introduction.

Unlike the resting days, you’ll try to get 70% of your calories from fats, 25% from proteins and 5% from carbs. All of these percentages give or take. 

The main point is **fats &gt; proteins &gt; carbs**. Why would you do that? Well, I hope the point about fats is clear enough.

You need to keep most of your calories coming from fats to keep your insulin levels down and force your body to keep running on your adipose tissue.

However, you need protein to prepare the damaged muscles from your workout. But eating a lot and a lot of proteins, say +50% of your calories are from proteins - your body will take what it needs to prepare the muscle tissue and transform the rest into glucose causing insulin peaks.

What I eat on workout days:

* 150g of chicken breasts and 100g of turkey
* 50g of liver
* 40g of beef sausage
* 20-30g of bacon
* 3 boiled eggs
* 50-100g of some nuts.

I’m not saying that carbs are evil here. If you get less than 20g of carbs for a long period of time, you’ll start losing muscle weight which is not good. What I’m saying is that it’s all about **moderation**. 

Eating anything in excess will fvck you up no matter how healthy it looks. Just always try eating in the range of 500 calories deficit.

# 3. What to be aware of:

1. If you see sugar, run the fvck away. Again. **Do not eat sugar** under any circumstances. That shit has the same effect as ethanol from alcohol and is stored directly as fats. Your body doesn’t burn it. It doesn’t need it. Seriously, avoid it at all costs. That little chocolate bar you grab at the grocery or whatever is the devil in the details that keeps that belly hanging or those man boobs bouncing.
2. Contrary to preconceived misconceptions, if your BDM is 2000 calories, and happened to ingest that amount of calories, it doesn’t mean that you have to run for miles to burn all of those calories and lose weight. Actually, your body (your brain, your inner organs… everything from the inside) will be burning 70-80% of the calories too. Movement and exercise only burn 6%-10% of the total calories consumed. So even on rest days you’ll be burning calories like a mothafvcka even without walking or doing anything.
3. Water. Keep hydrated. Drink water until your urine is clear (if you’re exercising).
4. Eating in a caloric deficit will leave you hungry (in the beginning). That’s a fact. With fats, the hunger cravings will take much more time to occur. But it is inevitable. Deficit of 500 calories will leave you craving food at some point, and guys, that’s what separates people with abs and people with fats. That’s when you should do your best to not eat anything as to keep the cycle described above up and running. For the last week, I fucked up when it comes to this point. I ate when I felt hungry late at night and didn’t surpass my BDM. Results? Same weight throughout the whole week, even though I workout 4 times a week.
5. Drop the alcohol and the energy drinks.

Remember **CONSISTENCY** is **KEY**!!! 

You have the **BLUEPRINT** \- now it’s up to **YOU**. 

Who do you wanna be a few months from now?

Paleo,How often can I eat chicken liver?,"Hi all,  


I was just wondering how often I can eat chicken livers, what with the fat soluble vitamins (especially A) being an issue. I've seen people say once or twice a week is definitely safe — though what about something like every other day or every day, one or two livers? I've seen some mention of people eating ""frozen liver pills"" made from beef liver everyday, but I don't know how that would stack against the chicken liver. The beef liver has higher vitamin A than the chicken liver, for instance, but said ""pills"" are just tiny portions of the whole liver and I guess possibly then lower than a whole chicken liver? Any insight is appreciated.",1613098211

Paleo,Mental health and Paleo,"So I've been having some trouble with my health for a long time now. I never could pinpoint what exactly is making me feel sick all the time, but I think I have a theory.

 Side note: If you live in America, you know how the Healthcare system is here - so don't come for me because I haven't had official tests done. 

Everytime I would eat dairy, I would feel nauseous. The same thing would happen with anything that had gluten in it. I dont know why it took me years to put two and two together, but I'm pretty sure I have a gluten and dairy sensitivity. I have all the symptoms. And my mental health has been absolute shit lately and I've been doing everything I can to try to get better - but nothing is working. I read somewhere that food sensitivities can actually cause mental health issues. 

I didnt eat any gluten or dairy today and I am already starting to feel a bit better. Two days ago, I had two huge bowls of cereal and had a mental breakdown and couldn't sleep all night, then felt like id been hit by a truck the next day. 

Has anyone else had this kind of experience with food affecting their mental health? I'm super excited that I will finally start feeling better but I have some concerns.

 First, is it dangerous to only eat fruit, veggies and meat for every meal? (Missing vitamins or essential stuff for functioning properly?). Second, should I take a multivitamin to make up for any lost nutrition? Third, should I do this gradually or is it ok to give up all dairy and gluten at once? 

Like I said, I would go to a doctor but Healthcare here is a joke and I dont need a blood test to tell me that these things make me feel sick when I eat them. Also, my dad had a gluten sensitivity and I hear it can be hereditary.

Paleo,[Question] Struggling with reaching my goal of 2500 cal/day but feeling full all day. Any paleo friendly foods/snacks suggestions to help reach calorie goals?,"I recently started doing paleo. I am trying to gain weight but want to do it in a clean(er) way, hence I decided to stick to paleo. Based on my calculations, I am trying to start off with 2500 calories per day. However I am really struggling to get even anywhere close to that. I track my meals on myftinesspal. Just to show an example, here is my meals for today:

Breakfast: 3 boiled eggs with shredded lettuce and half an avocado

Post-workout: 1 scoop gold standard whey with water (I know this is not strictly paleo but please bear with me)

Lunch: Half of a whole grilled chicken with a small salad bowl (lettuce + cucumbers + carrots in lemon juice)

Snacks: Half a cup blueberries + 2-3 strawberries + 10-12 nuts (almonds + cashews)

Dinner: 200g Salmon Filet with Brocolli

Combining all of these, I'm almost at 1500 calories for the day. But I felt pretty much full after every single one of these meals and I thought I would have eaten close to my goal, but looks like I'm way short.

Are there any paleo friendly meals or snacks that would help me catch up on my calories goals? I see nuts and nuts butter suggested for catching up on calorie targets, but at the same time I also see many paleo proponents warn of going overboard with nuts and fruits.",1612980428

Paleo,Currently eating a 100% carnivore diet considering adding some carbs back.,"I've experienced lots of improvement on Carnivore, but I've also run into some issues. Firstly I was eating junk from the gas station and drinking Pepsi almost exclusively for many years. I had terrible eczema that would leave my entire arm open and bleeding profusely. I wanted to eat healthier and I discovered the Carnivore diet. I've been eating this way for a little over 8 months now. I've experienced an incredible improvement in my skin, absolutely no more eczema or acne. My hair is the best it's ever been and my energy is more stable after becoming fat adapted.

Unfortunately, I've also been dealing with chronic diarrhea and digestive issues. In the entire 8 months that I've eaten this way the number of solid stools I've had I could count using the fingers on my hands. Really this wasn't too big a deal to me considering all the benefits I was experiencing. I just hoped that it would go away, but it never did. I played around with the amount of fat I was eating but I never got anywhere. Adjusting ratios did me nothing. On top of that my sleep is really unreliable. I tend to wake up several times at night and at the worst, I woke up a couple of times per hour every hour.

Also my hands are pretty cold all the time. The rest of my body is very warm and I can tolerate the cold extremely well. But I'm a bit self-conscious about my cold hands when everyone around me has very warm ones. I can't remember if my hands were always like this and I don't think that carnivore necessarily created this issue. But I wonder if adding some carbs back into the diet could resolve that and the other issues.

On carnivore I try to eat nose to tail and eat lots of liver, eggs, fish, etc. Plenty of fatty steaks cooked blue. I add butter sometimes.

I'm a little nervous to add carbs back into the diet. I'm nervous that my eczema will return or that I'll wake up to find acne on my face again. I've been battling these skin issues my entire life and now that they're gone I want them to stay gone. But I also want to keep in mind that I've never eaten a diet like this for an extended period of time before. My diet history was swinging from one extreme to the other. I don't know what I'll find if I eat more ""normal"" or ""balanced"" whatever those words mean. Even while increasing variety I want to remain 80%-90% animal-based.

When attempting to add carbs back into the diet, what would you suggest I incorporate? I'm already considering sweet potatoes and blueberries. Any veggies that aren't going to be too inflammatory? I think I'll continue to avoid nightshades.",1612356003

It all started when her doctor told her that she needed to make some serious lifestyle changes if she wanted to avoid obesity-related health problems. Today, her husband is on the diet too, and they both swear that it's improved their energy levels. ""He was a keto-skeptic but now he's as healthy as can be,"" she wrote on Instagram alongside photos of their keto diet before and after transformations. ""We get our blood work done every 3–6 months since we started keto in April 2017 and I'm happy to report every single blood test has come out great. Our energy is through the roof and people that surround us are probably annoyed of us talking about keto.""

Paleo,Keto Sucess Stories How She Did it ???,"When it comes to popular weight-loss methods, the keto diet is here to stay. And one of the biggest reasons it's surpassed fad-diet status is because of the keto weight-loss success stories it has produced. If you're on a weight-loss journey, you've probably come across it on your social media feed, from friends, family or through co-workers.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether you choose to do a lazy keto, dirty keto or traditional keto, the amount of ways the high-fat, low-carb diet can be done is innumerable. And the flexibility has also made it doable for newbies. One note: This diet isn't exactly meant to be done long-term, according to Scott Keatley, RD, of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy. (It's a little too restrictive for that.)

Ultimately, you and your doc. should decide if the keto diet, or any diet, is right for you. But in the meantime, here's a whole list of crazy-inspirational keto diet success stories.

If you want some awesome keto diet tips and diferent meal plants let me know and i wouldcmore than happy to send them to you all the information I have found for free as it will save a lot of time looking for diferent keto plants etc.

I am a 26-year-old from India, suffering from a mild depression and anxiety disorders.

I suffer from mild apathy, lower self esteem (due to depression), anxiety, and mild anhedonia, due to this. I had and have a few gut related disorders since a few days before my onset (in early 2019). So I think they are strongly connected, with the level of quickness the depression came, after the gut problem started. 

So, if I go Paleo, with sufficient fiber and electrolyte and vitamin/mineral supplements, should that be enough? I am okay if I need to do this diet life-long. It will help my mental states, immunity and reduces chances of any metabolic or serious age related problems in the future.

Paleo,To everyone who suffers from neck or back pain.. read this.,"Just wanted to share my experience in managing chronic neck and back pain for close to 20 years now. I've tried almost every solution you can think of -- orthopedics, chiropractic, physiotherapists, massage sessions, yoga etc. but nothing ever seemed to work. I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.

The second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.

Hopefully this changes someone's life the way it did for mine :') Cheers, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any other tips!",1610969905

Paleo,Energy levels low?,"TL;DR: new to paleo, feeling low energy, am I doing something wrong?

Background: 
31F started paleo ~3 weeks ago. Starting weight 205. I’m 5’7” so I’m overweight and should be closer to 140ish (I don’t care much about the weight itself, just the health problems that go along with that)

Progress:
I’ve really been enjoying paleo. I’m finding it very easy and fun. I’ve lost a little over 4 lbs already. I’m not struggling with cravings as severely as I thought I would be which has been wonderful, and any cravings I do have are satisfyingly replaceable with healthy alternatives.

Problem:
but the last 2 or 3 days I’ve been feeling very sleepy and have a much lower appetite. I’m wondering if maybe I need to up my calories, fat, protein, etc or something? Has anyone else experienced this? It’s possible it’s a fluke or unrelated to the diet change, I just figured y’all would be the best people to ask.

Thank you!",1610732826

Paleo,My experiences with paleo diet (Lost 4 Lbs),"I have been wanting to lose weight for a whole year, but I didn't want to change my diet. I mean I did but just the will power to stay on something is hard! Even though I knew that changing my diet would be better than me hustling at the gym harder, you don't know till you feel it! During those times I would do a lot more cardio at the gym trying to burn off the fat. Grinding 5-6x a week, doing a bunch of cardio and then weight lifting afterwards. Saw no change in weight.. not only that but my joints started to hurt more from the over training.

In comes paleo! I have done paleo in the past and figured I would tackle it the same way.. and it worked again! My goal was to take all those processed garbages out of my body and then worry about the caloric intake. Actually, I found that once I take those processed garbage out and put the nutrition in, my body naturally regulates the caloric intake. 

Day 1-4 :  I binged on more nuts than I'm proud to admit. In this period, I think my brain linked dopamine with food in an unhealthy way. Maybe it's the sugar, the cheese, i'm not sure but pistachios were my gateway food to paleo. It allowed me to wean off of snack type foods. I ate other easier to prepare foods such as chicken, LOTS of Chicken.. and broccoli,cauli. 

Day 4-10 : I started cooking foods that were more complex, I figured if I'm doing this paleo thing.. let me cook meals that seem more ""normal"" with coconut milk, belled peppers, cashews, and ofcourse LOTS of chicken. Started adding eggs, it's good! 

\*Days 1-10\* : I went to the grocery store like every day.. maybe it was out of boredom from lack of dopamine and my brain rewiring but it was creepy how often I would go! Often times just to grab a box of lime seltzer though I would peruse all the aisles anyway.

Day 10-15: This is where I started to feel pretty naturally regulated. I can't pinpoint what happened, but my brain rewired itself to search after unprocessed foods. If I were to look at a bag of chips, there was no association of it being food or exciting. I'd be happy to see my plate of food that is unprocessed. I'd feel full after eating a meal, and I wouldn't just eat to eat, I would eat when I was hungry and stop when I was satiated. My joints don't feel tight in the mornings, my energy levels are higher, I don't have that ""my health is garbage right now I should change something"" feeling. 

I am not sure if this post will be good for anyone, but I had a need to share to the world! Losing weight is the side effect now! The goal is to just feel great again and it's easy to keep wanting to feel great!

As a side note, the last time I did paleo which was \~3 years ago, I took the grains such as rice, pasta and bread out and they didn't really creep their way back in. I would eat them occasionally, 1-2 a week but maybe the transition would be tougher for someone who has been eating them regularly. :-3",1610713466

Neither do animals. Cats sometimes eat grass, while cows sometimes eat rodents. My parents dog tries to eat fruit.    


Plants provide beneficial compounds for your health (bromelain, antioxidants) and provide fibre for your gut bacteria (though their interactions are not well understood), while meat provides fat soluble vitamins, B vitamins, bioavailable protein and iron, and omega 3.   If humans were cars - meat is the construction material and the fuel, while plants are the finishing paintworks, the fancy DVD player and fancy leather seats.

Paleo,"A look at professional CrossFit athlete Mat Fraser's daily training routine &amp; diet: ""I’m not trying to break a four-minute mile. I’m not trying to squat 800 pounds. I’m trying to run a five-minute mile and squat 500 pounds.""","Fraser’s daily routine begins when he wakes up between 7.30-8.30am, after getting his required 9 to 10 hours of sleep. His fiancee, Sammy, who prepares all his meals, has breakfast and coffee waiting for him. “I’m having coffee and food within two minutes of being awake—your classic three-part breakfast of bacon, eggs, and oatmeal,” he told GQ in a 2018 profile.

When it comes to his nutrition, Fraser likes to keep it simple. With Sammy cooking and preparing his meals, Fraser’s primary focus is just to avoid junk food and stick mainly to rice, meat, vegetables and fruit. During the Crossfit Games training season, Fraser can consume up to 7,000 calories per day.

“Right after a competition, when I take my off season and I’m not training at all, I’m eating maybe one or two meals a day,” he told weightlifting website BarBend. “Then when I start ramping back up, I’m only training once a day, so I’m probably hitting three or four thousand calories. And when I’m in full swing, my only purpose in the day is I wake up and everything is directed toward training, that’s when the calories increase to six or seven thousand calories.”

After dropping the pints of ice cream and half dozen donuts, which made regular appearances in his diet during the early days, Fraser is able to avoid the rollercoaster of sugar highs and energy dips throughout his diet, leading to a more consistent training routine.

By 9.30am, he’s at his Crossfit gym working through conditioning, weightlifting, strength training and metabolic conditioning until 1pm, when he heads home for lunch. After eating, he’ll hang around for a couple of hours before heading back to the gym for an afternoon session.

Fraser described his training routine in an interview with Men’s Fitness:

&gt;Four days a week it’s a minimum of two sessions a day: get to the gym at, say, 10am, leave the gym at 1pm, and get back in at 3pm for another three-hour session. What is actually in those sessions depends on what part of the season we’re in, but usually we’re looking at three track sessions a week, three to four weightlifting sessions, a couple of swimming sessions and one road bike day. That’s a very loose idea, though, because it’s always changing.

Training finishes up between 5-6pm and he’ll head home for dinner (“anything from steak and potatoes to enchiladas to tacos”), unwind with some TV and do some stretches and recovery exercises like stretching and foam rolling. He also uses a TheraGun, especially after a heavy quad workout. Fraser usually heads off for bed at around 9.30-10pm.

Anywho my parents specifically my mom keeps reeling me my diet is killing me. She’s an elderly women in her 80’s so I don’t really pay much attention to it most of the time but it pisses me off when she says that since she’s a fall down drunk riddle with health problems. She even had alcoholic wet brain witch is brain as in shrinkage caused by alcoholism. Out of all the people to take health advice from she’s not even in the list to talk about it. My aunt is kinda the same until recently she went to the doctor and found out she has insulin resistance. She currently does keto I believe lost 80 pounds in like 5 or so months. Few days ago she took my mom to go some clothes shopping I was totally against it d sad once Covid but when they came back they had fast food.

Paleo,Give me your best vegetarian or low-meat dinner recipes!,"I’ve finally convinced the family to go primal with me (we drink raw milk from cows we know personally and I’m just not going to give up dairy). The only problem is that we live in a HCOL country where meat is especially expensive (due to the high minimum animal welfare standards), so I can’t take the easy road of just doing veggies and roasts for dinner every night. 

So I need new dinner ideas to feed my family that are meatless (or use meat as a condiment) but also grain-free, and that are kid-friendly. (My kids are good eaters and like healthy foods, but of course they are still kids and especially like pasta and pizza.)

Last night, I made stuffed mushrooms, roasted cauliflower with Indian spices, and sweet potato fries. One kid ate only the cauliflower, one kid didn’t eat dinner at all (because it was all gross), and the other made herself a caprese salad instead. Not a home run.

Paleo,[Blogspam] Sun Exposure and Human Health,"One of the most overlooked health habits is getting regular sun exposure. Objectively speaking, this is probably the single most important factor after proper food, water, and sleep. Bright light exposure to our retinas regulates proper serotonin and melatonin expression - vital for mood and sleep. And, of course, allows us to synthesize vitmamin D in our skin, which is actually not a vitamin, but a seco-steroid hormone. 

Our ancestors probably received 10x more sun exposure than we do nowadays.

Here's an article I've done summarizing and distilling all of the proven health benefits of sun exposure - or rather the proven consequences of a sun deficiency.

Included is a robust bibliography containing hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies of all types.

1) I feel full after eating...but I don’t feel /satisfied/ without the ‘bread’ (grains of some kind)

Is this a normal part of it? Like when you stop eating sugar and your body is like “you need sugar!” Lol. Are their any non-grain foods that helped fill this for you?

2) For the entire 10 or so years I’ve been cooking I’ve built my meals *around* the grain...pasta, rice, bread, etc was the foundation that meats and veg were added to, so I sort of don’t know where to start now. 

It feels like it’s missing something just meat + veg at dinner. What do you do? Leafy greens? My husband and 15 yo son are both big eaters.

It was missing the creaminess. I tried mayonnaise as the marinade for the chicken. It was alright but nothing like the dairy versions I’ve made.

Paleo,Does saturated fat intake cause your pores to become plugged with sebaceous filaments?,"**Hey all.**

&amp;#x200B;

**HISTORY AND SYMPTOMS:**

I suffer terribly with Sebaceous filaments, basically solidified sebum that seems to fill every single pore on my body/face/scalp, the longer they are left untouched the more they will start to actually poke out of my skin like little rice grains! They completely ruin my confidence, their making huge pore holes all over my face and spreading these pores across my face and it looks disgusting when they fill up the pores so quickly!

Now i first started noticing these sebaceous filaments in 2017 after flipping from a very low fat diet with zero sat fat, consisting of lots of salmon, eating carbs etc to a diet that consists of more saturated fat/Cholesterol (but still with carbs): Grass fed butter, Coconut oil, eggs, red meat etc, had massive improvements in testosterone and overall androgenic profile but noticed these filaments plaguing my skin. So for the last 3 years i've eaten pretty high saturated fat, this year i'm trying to put extra weight on and am spending a lot of time weight lifting. I may consume upwards of 80g-100g of a combo of butter/coconut oil a day, which is actually working great for me, apart from the skin problem which could be from it?

I have tried lowering the fat a lot but didn't seem to make much difference and i was much hungrier without it and didn't feel right just increasing extra carbs, i didn't try it for that long at all though.

I don't see anyone else moaning about this problem anywhere in the keto/high fat community so i’m wondering if its got anything to do with the higher sat fat intake.

&amp;#x200B;

.......

&amp;#x200B;

**THEORY, I've spoken to someone on another forum somewhere who has come up with this theory on cholesterol, saturated fats and sebum production:**

""Based on the research I've done on skin health, the most likely culprit (in my opinion) is a lipid called squalene peroxide. It's basically this sludgy, sticky lipid that is what is referred to as ""comedogenic"", because it does exactly what I described earlier: sits in the follicle and clogs it up.""

""I have a theory that elevated LDL cholesterol levels increase squalene production in the sebaceous gland. (thus, increasing the potential for and quantity of squalene peroxide formation). The interesting thing is that squalene is a precursor to cholesterol, so it makes sense that cholesterol oversupply might lead shunt the cholesterol synthesis pathway back down to squalene, leading to increased squalene accumulation.""

""cholesterol --&gt; shunting squalene --&gt; squalene peroxide --&gt; pore clogs.""

&amp;#x200B;

....

&amp;#x200B;

**MY DIET, BLOOD RESULTS ETC:**

\- A link to my cholesterol levels\*\*:\*\* at the top the most recent test done Sept 2020 and the results below that are from March 2017, [New cholesterol levels at top, old levels at bottom.](https://imgur.com/a/1kZ4Y79)

\- Another extensive blood test i had recently: [August 2020, Fasted, Morning blood test.](https://imgur.com/a/d4813g6)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

..............

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**QUESTIONS:**

What do you all think i should do?

\-Should i cut the saturated fat out completely for some time to test it out, how long?

\-Do you think it's got nothing to do with sat fat intake and instead its something else like thyroid function?

\-Or based on the logic above fro, that guy, should i not cut out saturated fat but work on ways to lower cholesterol levels? How if so?

\-Has ANYONE here massively increased their saturated fat intake and noticed these sebaceous filaments forming?

Thanks all, i really hope someone can help!

Paleo,[Question] Concerns regarding starting Paleo lifestyle with a low BMI,"Hello!

I'd like to do a ""Whole30""-style reset program (I've heard good things about Chris Kresser's version?) and then gradually reintroduce ""gray-area"" foods to see which things may have negative affects on things like my gut health and depression/anxiety. Although I've been very loosely adhering to a Paleo diet for a couple weeks now (ie. eating less grains and trying to make up the difference with vegetables and fruits) I feel it already hasn't been going great - I've rapidly lost weight, which for me is dangerous considering my BMI is already pretty low (it's around 16-17 right now). I'm worried I'm 1) not eating enough overall and 2) not getting enough carbs from non-grain sources. I'm worried I will only continue to lose weight if I go on one of these programs, as they are much more strict than the way I've been eating. If anyone could help me with these concerns I'd be much obliged. For reference, my typical day of meals is as follows:  


Breakfast: two eggs, slice of wheat toast, half a tomato or an apple, and either a handful of cashews or half an avocado

Lunch: Sandwich of a veggie pattie between two slices of wheat bread, usually with a slice or two of tomato and some mayo &amp; mustard. The veggie pattie ingredients in order of listing on package are: kale, pea protein, expeller-pressed canola oil, water, spinach, onions, sweet potatoes, carrots, corn, red peppers, water chestnuts, potato flakes, cooked quinoa, cooked brown rice, zucchini, broccoli, arrowroot powder, rice starch, cooked millet). Calories are 150/pattie. Usually I do carrots, half an apple and/or half a banana in addition to the sandwich.

Third meal/snack: usually a bunch of baby carrots, sometimes celery. Sometimes I'll do almond butter with these.

Dinner: Usually 4/5 small filets of fish (these are breaded), and a hefty portion of veggies (usually broccoli, cauliflower, or green beens).",1606927430

I had my genome sequenced recently, and essentially the entire report lit up with studies that showed better weight loss/weight maintenance/lower insulin resistance on a higher carb, lower fat diet.

This goes COMPLETELY AGAINST all the recent nutrition science in the keto sphere. And yet this week I've been eating higher carb and lower fat and am feeling far more satiated than I have in months-- ON FEWER CALORIES.

Few days ago we were discussing with friends of mine (through sms as it is the lockdown here) and the subject of veganism came. I could not argue against it due to my lack of research etc. 

So my question is what do you respond to :

•Veganism prevent the suffering and exploitation of animals (it is unethical to eat meat, etc) 
•The environment would benefits from not eating animal based food as it allow to use more space to grow plant to feed human.
•It is healthy to eat vegan if properly planned and in the worst case you can have supplement (bacteria producing B12, etc).
•Vegan permaculture can exist if there are the plant which fixe the nitrogen.

Paleo,Why an 88 YEAR OLD Had Normal Blood Cholesterol Despite Eating.. 25 Eggs/Day,"An 88 year old man who consumed 25 eggs a day for the best part of 15 years was found to have no history of stroke, heart or kidney disease. 

His ECG findings were all normal and what's more he was also found to have completely normal blood cholesterol levels; which bewildered his doctors and scientists alike because it was 1991 and common wisdom at the time had it that the more cholesterol you consumed in your diet, the higher your blood cholesterol would be (which in itself is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease).

Eggs are some of the richest cholesterol sources out there, yet despite consuming roughly 5000mg of cholesterol (or 16x the RDI); this 88 year old man seemed to get by just fine.

That's because dietary cholesterol actually does not  equate to blood cholesterol as the majority of your blood cholesterol is made up of cholesterol that is manufactured endogenously inside of you!

Your body can also reduce the amount of cholesterol absorbed in response to a greater intake of dietary cholesterol; this 88 year old man was consuming so much dietary cholesterol that his body responded to this influx by only absorbing around 18% of it.

Paleo,"Oil, Butter, GERD, and Paleo","So I was really hoping Paleo alone would fix my digestion and reflux but it hasn't. Things have gotten a little better and I know things take time, but I've been eating tons of mostly just veggies and meat lately, alittle fruit but not too much, and sun butter. 

The thing is bread, rice, oats and pasta DO  definitely trigger my reflux, so I cut those out, even my beloved gluten free crackers....but I'm still burping, feeling that lump sensation and acid feeling in my throat. Sometimes when I burp I feel the food come up a little. 

Again it's not as bad but it's not cured. My question is what the heck and I'm doing wrong? Could it be the oil I'm using? I am cooking most of my food in olive oil or coconut oil, or adding butter and ghee. Do I need to cut the fats out for awhile? The only seasoning I am using is mostly just salt, or sometimes sage and cinnamon. 

I'm suspicious it's the oil. But I'm also about 5'5, 120 lbs so I really can't afford to lose more weight at this point. Hence why I still add the fats. So frustrated. I am also using pepcid every day for about the last month. Was hoping I could ween off them but not at this point. 

I know stress is a big factor and I am under a huge amount of stress right now and I am working on that through meditation and mindfulness, also diaphragmatic breathing seems to help. But I also do feel like food is still setting me off somehow. 

Any suggestions? Should I just steam or boil foods for awhile until I can heal more?",1605727446
Paleo,"I'm not doing good with this diet, constantly starving and it's killing me","Hey everyone,

DISCLAIMER - doing this regarding mental health improvements


I guess ditching carbs was the reason for this, no more - rice, oats, whole wheat bread, pasta. No more dairy - whole milk 3%, chocolate milk, yoghurt, greek yoghurt, cottage etc. No more sugars - chocolate, cookies, brownies. 

On other side, I am supposed to eat till 4.000 calories to move my scale up, I need to bulk anyways, too skinny for my years spent in gym, I'm 6'5, now less then 180lb. 

I did saved some money by throwing out certain foods but again lack additional 500kc to bulk, I'm currently eating 3.500kc, non-stop hungry, not-satisfied. I always had problems with food, I guess some food disorder is on my list. Monotonous food, bland taste, bored with same food, bored with eating because I fuck something up in process and waste all food at the end of week - for example eating 6 days up to T and fuck up sunday and end up - 500 to 1000 calories in week summary, so no weight gain. Imagine that lasting for years, you got bored and unmotivated

For the sake of calories I'm using from time to time - rice or coconut milk(it has bunch of sugar, but whole pack of 1L is about 700calories, popcorn bag=400kc, walnuts/100g=650kc, peanut butter=50g/350kc, olivier salad=100g/172cal

Now it’s 4PM, I haven’t had breakfast yet, had a dinner leftover since last night that I can’t make myself to eat. It’s not tasty, now even cold, bland, boring, and knowing that I had to do same again this day it’s not making me motivated to continue down this road, and on other hand I had no other choice but to do it this way(meant for ditching certain foods and keeping on low carb-high fat-mod(want higher)protein content. Would go much lower on carb section if I had substitutes or ideas

For example this is my meal plan for quite some time

1. Breakfast - 6 eggs omelette = 468cal, bacon 50g = 209cal, kulen 50g(dried meat) = 227cal, pork rinds 50g = 265cal, 1tbsp olive oil = 100kc, olivier salad = 172kc       that’s total = 1460kc
2. Lunch - 200g of chicken thighs with skin = 423kc, 500g of back red potatoes = 470kc, 1tbsp olive oil = 100kc        that’s total = 1012kc
3. Lunch - 200g of chicken thighs with skin = 423kc, 500g of back red potatoes = 470kc, 1tbsp olive oil = 100kc        that’s total = 1012kc

And this totalling at 3500 calories of which 172g protein, 226g carbs, 200g fat

Any change od diet would mean much for me. It’s for lack of money at the time that’s making this a lot harder then it is. I do enjoy eating breakfast like that, it’s awesome, but potatoes and meat, it’s killing me. Any other carb source it’s either short of calories or I simply can not handle it in my stomach

My digestive system is weirdest thing I know that directly influence my mood any time it’s not working properly

Hold on coffee, strict(I guess if I don’t know for some hideous ingredients) at NO dairy, NO sugar, NO gluten, NO grain(rice). I'm failing at smoking(triggers anxiety) and drinking once a week energy drink

I had the same problem years ago too. Usually take up on same monotonous diet and eat it till I get sick of it and then changes it, now it’s a bit difficult and I need someones help! I did great at bulking when I started to lift, believe me or not I gained more then 40kg for 2 years, actually ate big variety but I really looked awful and bloated, acne, skinny fat, gained weight extremely quickly but never looked I actually have it that much. Now after some life issues and situations I lost 15kg and stalling and tipping in place since then, for years basically. Few months ago I got this idea to try all of these elimination thing and I do feel much different, only to say better. I know what’s triggering my bad mood, anxieties and some depressions, I’m much more stable then I used too!

Now for that meal plan - I can do few things, change a bit and add some(this would need more money therefore getting a job, no probs), changing food at same price as current one and adding new recipes and ingredients and spices

Any thoughts and suggestions, thanks a lot

Paleo,Why are potatoes not paleo?,"I understand that paleo focuses on eating foods from the Paleolithic era that existed before agriculture.   


So, one argument states that non-paleo foods are those that have been harvested by the use of ranching or agriculture, such as grains or cane sugar; legumes, such as lentils, beans, peanuts and peas; and dairy products. However, this argument would also ban spinach and berries since we have been harvesting them with agriculture as well. I find this argument unsatisfactory.     


I think we shouldn't eat legumes because those require boiling to not make us sick, and Paleolithic era people didn't have metal pots to boil legumes in. We shouldn't eat cane sugar because that requires a tremendous amount of processing. We shouldn't eat dairy because crawling under a wild cow and sucking on its titts is dangerous. While paleolithic people may have eaten some raw grains, I don't think that was enjoyable nor do I think they ate many of them. Processing grains into an enjoyable food would have taken way too much work. So, we ban grains.   


Now, let's talk about potatoes. What would stop a paleolithic person from digging up a potato, covering it in mud, and baking that potato in a fire? I see no reason for a Paleolithic person to not be able to eat a potato.",1605364484
Paleo,I tried out every diet under the sun. Paleo is best. Here I share what I learned.,"There are many diets out there. Nutrition is like religion, people protect their diet with their lives. Different diets work for different people. But there is a diet you can´t go wrong with.

Different diets work for different people. But there is a diet almost everyone does well on (that does NOT mean people don´t do well on other diets as well). This is the diet we evolved with over the last couple hundred thousand years or so.

Most people do well with a diet quite low in carbs (titrated to leanness and activity), while the main energy source should be good fats. Cycling occasionally into ketosis keeps you metabolically flexible. Eat meats. Avoid dairy, sugar, excessive quantities of omega-6 fatty acids. Once you found what works, not much variety is needed from a health perspective.

Don´t miss the forest for the trees. Following these few points gives you 80% of the benefit for 20% effort. Overfocusing on tiny details is pointless.

I am a med student becoming a functional medicine doctor in a year. I tried out every diet under the sun and found paleo to be best and healthiest (not just based on personal experience).

I wrote a short guide about a diet that literally everyone does well on.

Enjoy.

Paleo,PM me for free personal weight loss help," Hey everyone,

My name is Jackson and I am 21 year old studying nutrition at Cal Poly. Here's a little about my weight loss story.

All throughout high school and into my freshman year of college I was the ""overweight kid"". People would joke about my weight and I would go along with it and act like it didn't hurt my feelings when it actually really did. (I was 6ft 270lbs)

When I started college I didn't really have a direction in life yet so I went into nutrition hoping that it would help me out. All throughout freshman year I gathered a bunch of knowledge about nutrition and how to be healthy but I didn't implement anything until sophomore year.

So last year I decided that I wanted to make a real change in my life. I had all the knowledge to do so but lacked motivation so I got myself a weight loss coach. Even though I already knew what foods I should be eating, this weight loss coach really helped me with motivation and accountability.

So over the last year I have been able to drop 75 pounds \[from 270 to 195\] (which is my goal weight)

Now that I have come so far in my journey I want to help out other people.

If you are struggling at all with weight loss then, send me a PM

I will give you my personal phone number and we will make a weight loss plan exactly for your personal goals and lifestyle.

I feel that as someone who has actually been ""fat"" I understand the struggles of someone who is overweight and I can help out better than someone who has been fit their entire lives!

So shoot me a PM and lets lose ya some weight!

PM me and I will personally help you lose weight",1604965862

Workout 

20 minutes of ashtanga yoga

Dumbbell flys- 3x5

Cooldown - overheard arm pull, rear lunge, extend and flex, thigh stretcher, single leg over

Post workout meal- Peach protein shake

Cardio - Leisurely walk

In 2019 I also became physically active, plus added Intermittent fasting. Went from 12 hour fasting to an OMAD lifestyle towards the end. 
Apart from the first month or so when body was adjusting to the change, i never had a problem with tiredness. In fact i was feeling pretty good. 
I also was pretty active physically in the 2019. But after the covid-related changes came in work and i was working from home,
I have kind of strayed away from the diet a lot/a bit. March-October 2020, I have been snacking a lot more, most of it things that are not allowed in the diet. 
(SWeet stuff, traditional fried stuff, fruits) My fasting window also reduced to about 16 hours. But my meals still stayed same as what i was eating in diet. (LCHF). Activity levels are low and will stay low with the covid in the air. Only an hour of brisk walking is what i am able to do.
Now from last 2 weeks I am trying to get back on the wagon seriously.
I have moved to a 20-hour fasting period. I have cut the snacking.  Note that i have a big cup (16 oz) of bulletproof coffee while on the fasting but that has remained same for last 2 years.

Paleo,new to paleo and need some help,"i've never really felt the need to follow any particular diet because i have a low appetite and never had any weight loss problems, but i'm starting to realise that just because i'm not overweight doesn't mean there isn't more i could be doing for my health. i think paleo is the best way to do that and i'm trying to transition my diet to be paleo-adjacent but i'm having two main difficulties:
1) i don't know how to get rid of bread. for now i'm just trying to reduce it but unlike processed sugar, which can be replaced with fruits or on occasion honey, bread is something that has no real replacement – it just needs to be removed entirely. i was wondering if anyone has advice on how to get rid of it because i'm having a hard time even going a day without it
2) although i don't eat a lot of sugar, sugar is easy calories and because i have a small appetite as, sometimes i rely on it for maintenance. since i've reduced my sugar intake my weight has already dropped and i want to avoid that. which foods are paleo but also calorie dense? i know nuts are paleo but the omega 6 in a lot of nuts concerns me",1604297937

• 18h
Yes, it is true that we do not allow very new accounts to post on our subreddit. What does anyone need from our subreddit that required them to post? Read ""The Fat of the Land"" and browse the active threads. You don't need to post. This is much nicer than some of the earlier community requirements that demanded a minimum of 30 days documented experience and had an application process before allowing someone to join.

Well, you should have this rule listed on your side panel. It isn't there. So could you please explain what is the minimum ""age"" requirement in order to be allowed to speak? You still haven't told me....

We don't talk about the specific numbers, as some people will attempt to game the system. What do you need to contribute that is so important we shouldn't hold you to the same standards as everyone else?

Maiden_of_Neptune • 10m
""We don't talk about specific numbers"" - that means you have no standards in place.

Maiden_of_Neptune • 3m
You are just deciding who is and isn't allowed to speak based on your whim. There is no equality if you do not have PUBLIC standards that ALL are held to. If you had any standards, then they would be made visible for all to see. You are very oppressive and evil. I will find a more intellectually honest forum to talk about carnivore where all are welcome.

I think Im doing more then good, I'm satisfied how I feel these days!

Few issues regards this type of diet - on some days my protein intake is really low, 150g usually, yesterday I had just 110g of protein, had to hop on a pick 1lb of chicken breast to satisfied my protein needs

Any tips how can I add more protein? It was much easier in days when I had dairy, whey protein etc. How about now, without it? 

Second thing is being hungry, most of the time, all the time. Waking up hungry, being hungry throughout day, being hungry while getting to sleep. I can't pick up chocolate milk or candy bar like I used to. Any tips? Even 200g+ of fat, mid carb intake and moderate to high protein intake(when I have beef my proteins are not problematic) I'm always hungry. Tips?

Paleo,Best Workout to Make a V shaped Body,"6 best Exercises that you can do to get a V-shaped Body

# 1. Lat Pull-down exercises

&amp;#x200B;

Lat Pulldowns are often done to produce the same activation as pull-ups. Being a compound exercise, lat pull downs help to recruit multiple muscle groups at a time.

Lat pull down exercises are performed using a machine. Different kinds of grips are used to target different areas of your back. Wide grip lat pull down exercises are recommended to widen your lats, hence work best to form the V-shape taper.

**Steps–**

* Use a wide bar and attach it to the pulley. Sit on the pull down machine and make sure you adjust the knee pads.
* Have a wide grip on the bar, which should be more than your shoulder width. Grab the bar with your palms. This shall target the lats.
* Now, pull the bar, by squeezing your back and pulling through your elbows. Bring the bar lower till it touches your chest. It is important to put your focus on the squeezing the back and the posterior deltoids (back shoulder) as well.
* Hold the bar at this position and slowly take it back to the original position to complete one rep.
* Tips: Reps are to be performed till you fill the muscle failure as you pull down. However, doing 12-15 reps per set of 2-3 sets per session is recommended.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. T-bar rowing exercises

Lat pull down exercises help you to get wider lats. But in order to have the perfect V-shaped body, it becomes important to focus on thickness of your back as well. The T-bar rowing exercises helps to increase the muscle density on your back, thus it is recommended.

**Steps–**

* Take a barbell and load it up with weights. One end should be positioned between the corners of walls using towels or attached to a landmine hosel.
* Bend down, till your upper body forms an angle of 450 with the floor, extend your arms.
* You can use a V-grip handle generally available in gyms and place it under the bar and hold it with both hands.
* Keep your lower back arched and pull the bar until it touches your chest.
* Keep your knees bent and pull your elbows as high as possible, facing upwards.
* As you pull up weights in the T-bar row exercises, the back muscles contract, which helps to increase the thickness. There are different versions of T-bar rows that you can add to your workout program.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips:** T-bar rows allow you to pick heavy weights as both hands are used. So, you can increase the weights and lower the reps and workout accordingly. 3-4 sets of 8-10 reps per set are recommended with heavy weights.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Standing Overhead (Dumbbell) shoulder Presses

You have to focus on your deltoids to ensure you widen your shoulder to get the broader area of the V-shaped body. Overhead press is an effective shoulder exercise, because of the compound movement it offers. Though this exercise focuses on different muscles, including your core muscles and side muscles, it primarily targets the lateral and anterior heads of the deltoids. Moreover, studies show that different versions of overhead presses can be used to lay more emphasis on anterior deltoids (front shoulders).

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps–**

&amp;#x200B;

* Take a dumbbell in each hand and stand with a stance little wider than shoulder width.
* Raise the dumbbells to the head height, keeping your elbows out at an angle of 900, which shall be the starting position.
* Keep the form right without leaning back or forward. Push through your elbow and raise the weights above your head.
* Hold there and then bring back slowly to the starting position, to complete one rep.
* Tips: Overhead presses enable you to pick heavy weights. However, stick to 10-12 reps per set of 2-3 sets per workout sessions in your upper body workout days. Keep the form right to avoid any injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. Lateral raise with dumbbells

This exercise is recommended to work out the lateral heads of the deltoids. This exercise also involves the anterior deltoid muscles and some part of the traps as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps-**

* Stand straight with a shoulder width stance and grab a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing inward. Allow the dumbbells to hang at your sides.
* Raise your arms to your sides keeping the wrist straight, till its gets in a line to your shoulders.
* Hold and bring it back slowly to its starting position to complete the rep.
* There are different ways of doing the lateral raises
* You can bend your knees a little to bring your shoulders in line with the centre of gravity.
* Or perform the exercise with some kind of chest support, keeping the impacts on shoulders completely.
* Tips: Focus on maintaining the motion of the exercise, do not move or bend your shoulders. Do not bounce while doing the lateral raises as it might cause muscle imbalances and lead to injuries. Doing 10-15 reps per set of 3-4 sets per session is beneficial.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Reverse Crunches

Reverse Crunches

When you look to have a V-shaped body, you need to focus on having a narrow waist. Thus, we recommend, not doing too much of heavy weight or resistance exercise, as it might build up more muscles.

**Steps–**

* Lie down on the floor with your legs fully extended and arms at the sides of your body keeping the palms on the floor.
* Move your legs up, making your thighs perpendicular to the floor.
* Now, as you inhale move your legs towards your body by rolling your hips backwards. Raise your hips off the floor.
* Keep doing it, till your knees touch your chest.
* Hold and move back slowly as you exhale and bring the legs back to the starting position.
* Tips: Doing 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps per set is recommended.

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. Vertical leg raise crunches

This is another great crunch exercise that you can add to your workout regime, to get chiselled and ripped abs. Vertical leg raise crunches are a low-impact exercise and very effective for strengthening the abdominal muscles.

**Steps-**

* Lie down on the floor, with your hands behind your head.
* Lift your legs up and keep them straight, without actually locking your knees. Cross your ankles. This is the starting position.
* Lift your torso and bend towards your knees. Here, you need to contract your abs; either you can push your head close to the knees or try to touch your toes with your hands. Exhale as you do it.
* Hold and get back to the starting position by inhaling.

I was thinking how can I help other people to do the same thing. I don\`t really want to create a weight loss program as there are already plenty of them. After some time with talking to other people I have found that many of you don\`t really know how to find and order keto friendly meals in restaurant. The only problem was that I haven\`t got much time. So I have decided to quit my job to have more time and freedom. Right after that I\`ve decided to create a website where you could find Paleo friendly restaurants and their Paleo meal options nearby your location.

I wondered if anyone had any research / thoughts / perspective on the choice of fresh fruits over frozen fruits. The reason I ask is because my nutritionist (and a fair amount of others bloggers I follow) say fruit should only be eaten locally and in season. So, apples from my home state of Colorado in September? Fine (they say). But frozen blueberries from Chile in January, for example, off limit. 

I know there’s SO MUCH debate around fruit - for understandable reasons, including nutritional makeup and ready availability in the 21sr century - and I just thought I’d ask. I’d eat the same proportion and moderation of frozen blueberries, if that helps steer the argument?

Paleo,Potatoes and thyroid problems,"I started the paleo diet about 3 month ago. Had sweet potatoes and chinese cabbage nearly every day. After some time I developed thyroid problems. I felt that the thyroid was swollen. 

I thought that it might be because of the goitrogens in the sweet potatoes and chinese cabbage (I eat pollock every day, so I get at least 550mcg iodine a day). I exchanged the chinese cabbage with lettuce and the sweet potatoes with peeled white potatoes. Symptoms got a lot worse.

I tried plantains for a few days and the symptoms were better, than when I have potatoes, but plantains make me nauseas.

The thyroid starts to swell about 30-60 minutes after the meal with poatoes. 
Has anyone had similiar experiences with potatoes or does anyone know where those symptoms could come from? 

I definitely eat enough iodine. My symptoms don't get better (or even worse, when i eat white potatoes) when I let the goitrogens away. Could it come from the oxalates (sweet potatoes?). Wouldn't explain why the symptoms get worse when eating potatoes though.

I'm kinda desperate, but really don't want to go to a doctor, because I want to be healthy and not only treat symptoms.",1601840580

Realistically the only non paleo thing that I actually eat now is some 45 calorie per slice whole wheat bread from Aldi that I make french toast with. I don't really eat sugar but I do put stevia and sweeteners in things. That being said, the paleo diet has always interested me for the whole foods approach to it. The reason I'm here is that I've had some trouble sleeping recently and was wondering if maybe paleo could help. 

That being said, I had a few questions about paleo. 

1. How do you know what an insulin spike feels like? I've had frequent urination pretty much all my life so I'm not sure how I'd be able to tell. 
2. I'm a decently active person. I bike about 12 miles or so 5 days a week. I lift weights 4 times a week. Rock climbing. In terms of carbs, I'm cool with eating potatoes all day long. I love them. I know people here also say if a food doesn't affect you badly, you can eat it. I'm sure people here have thrived on this diet. If anyone who reads this has, i'd love to hear about how it's helped or hindered you. 
3.  My question is how do you know if a food negatively affects you? Is it a physical response? Do people get rashes? Is it gut issues like bloating? 
4. In terms of sleep, has anyone's sleep improved with paleo?",1601725885

I am doing paleo + IF 16:8 close to 6 years now. Amount of carbs i eat in a day varies from 50g to 150g.

Lately i narrowed eating window down to 4-5 hours and i like it even more. I eat at 8am and 1pm and fast after that.

What i noticed is that if i eat carbs in my first meal (8am) it seem to give me anxiety lasting for the rest of the day. If i eat the same amount of carbs for 2nd meal (1pm) i am much better.  Why is that?

I am in good shape, exercise daily.

Paleo,Trouble transitioning back from vegetarian to paleo/primal + getting enough fat,"After almost a year of eating vegetarian in protest of factory farming, I came across an article convincing me that low carb is the way to go. I was very happy and healthy eating primal (I eat cheese) about 5 years ago, so I'm transitioning back to what I know.

My stomach has tolerated bone broth quite well, but I'm having a shitty (heh) time with non-liquids. I drank bone broth for ten days without a problem. On Saturday, I had a chicken drumstick. Today (Tuesday), I had 2 oz of beef.

I've had horrible stomach cramps and runny number 2. I know the meat itself wasn't bad because my omnivore husband had no problem eating much larger quantities of the same material.

In the meanwhile, I'm definitely not getting enough fat/protein. I have eggs in butter in the morning but otherwise I'm all veggies and a bit of fruit. I'm quite hungry since I've given up rice/beans, which was the bulk of my diet. I'm allergic to avocado and nuts but I've been historically happy to munch on seeds (chia, pumpkin, sunflower, etc) to help make up for fats, but I still don't think I'm getting enough.

Paleo,Jocko Paleo + intermittent fasting = life changing,"Hi all,

Just a quick intro, I'm a 25yr male about 5'8"" and 175 lbs currently. I learned about paleo thru Jocko Willink (NAVY SEAL) and he has a great podcast. And I already kinda lean towards intermittent fasting (never really ate breakfast growing up). But I have got to say, this no carbs, no sugar thing is INCREDIBLE! I thought I would be hungry or tired, but no! I never feel sluggish after lunch and falling asleep at the keyboard from 1-3 pm like I was used to. I dont have the need to overeat and feel like super full feeling that I was used to, its just incredible. I wake up at 4:30 am and go to bed around 9:30 pm, I workout as soon as I wake up and dont eat until noon at work (just a salad most days and somedays I bring salmon or tuna to add to it (probably 700 calories MAX). For anyone thats wondering about it, its like discovering a whole new world. I just feel overall better, lighter and more in-tuned with my body. I work out after work too (around 4:30-5:30 pm). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I realize that sugar and carbs are just basically like cigarettes, they're shit but they only aren't illegal because companies are still making money selling us all these fast food burgers. I mean just driving by a fast food place at 6 pm, their drive-thrus sometimes wrap around the building 2x.

Paleo,Super creamy coconut milk ice cream,"This ice cream has managed to convince my family that not all paleo desserts are a bummer ;) (I don't think so, but they are used to lots and lots of sugar).   


1 can of full fat coconut milk  
1/4 cup of coconut cream  
1/2 TBSP grass fed gelatin  
1/2-1 cup of coconut sugar (adjust as needed)  
1/2 cup of sunflower seed/almond butter  
2 tsp vanilla  
2 egg yolks  


(optional: 1/8 tsp of guar gum; not paleo but if flexible, this helps with texture and creaminess)  


Directions:  
1. Heat milk and cream together in a saucepan on medium heat. Whisk until fully incorporated  
2. Whisk in gelatin and sugar; add sunflower/almond butter  
3. Allow to simmer or come to a low boil for about 15 minutes (watch for overflowing!) The longer it cooks down, the more caramelized the flavor becomes  
4. Take off heat and allow to cool down until just warm  
5. Pour into blender with egg yolks and vanilla; blend at least 1 full minute, if not longer. The longer it blends, the smoother the final outcome will be  
6. Place mixture (either in blender or another container) into the fridge, preferably the back, and allow to completely cook for at least 4 hours. Ideally, 24-48 hours for a really creamy and smooth finish  
7. Pour into chilled ice cream maker tub and operate according to manufacturer's instructions  


Additions:   
\- Omit sun/almond butter and increase the cream to 3/4 a cup. Simmer 2 cups of frozen or fresh berries in coconut sugar and vanilla until soft and fragrant. Add to blender for berry sorbet  
\- Cinnamon, toasted almonds, maple syrup, and carob all make great additives   
\- Cashew butter and macadamia nuts with cinnamon makes a 'sugar cookie' ice cream

To store:  
\- Scoop ice cream into a metal loaf pan, preferably lined with plastic wrap or wax/parchment paper  
\- Wrap with plastic wrap, allowing it to completely touch the whole surface, which cuts down on ice forming  
\- Wrap with an additional layer of foil or similar insulation, and finally, a plastic bag  
\- If you can, store in the back of the freezer, which will prevent ice cream from cooling and refreezing, which makes it harder and more icy.",1599602241
Paleo,Traditional preparation methods of sweet potatoes (and goitrogens),"Hi,
do you guys know how primitive tribes prepare/prepared sweet potatoes and if they eat/ate the skin or not?

I'm concerned about the oxalate content and most of the oxalates are in the skin, but also most of the fiber, so I don't know what the better choice would be. 
I know that boiling reduces the oxalate content, but also the content of water soluble vitamins and minerals (especially potassium). 

I eat a lot of sweet potatoes, so I want to get it right and not do any long term harm to my body due to oxalates. That's why I'm interested how our primitive tribes do/used to do it.

Paleo,Paleo for endurance &amp; autoimmune disorders : any positive experiences?,"I upped my training a couple years ago and, to give a sense of perspective, now training for 42.2 and 70.3-type things. I had pretty much eliminated rice, pasta, processed sugar &amp; most processed food already at the same time I started getting serious about endurance training and felt much better -- I think this is due to being gluten- and histamine-intolerant, and probably also lactose intolerant (23andme genetic testing suggests this is indeed the case).

I tried the keto diet for almost a year but really struggled as it is really restrictive (plus: add the fact that being histamine intolerant I have to exclude a lot of food like cheese, olives, etc.). Moreover, got really tired of weighting every fucking gram of vegetable I had ; all along I really sensed it was counterproductive to restrict vegetables so much, maybe thus creating deficiencies, and I also struggled with the increased sodium/potassium/magnesium intake need on strict keto. I train a lot and already lose a lot of those in my sweat. No need for additional loss because of my diet.

That being said, been doing IF 16-8 for years &amp; training in a fasted state first thing in the morning. So I’m most probably quite adapted to burning fat.

The more I’m thinking about all that, the more I’m seeing similarities with my way of eating vs. the paleo diet. I’m a total newbie in regards to paleo, but my intuition tells me this could be the way to go. And actually I’m more or less *already* eating somewhat in a paleo way. Given my autoimmune disorders (gluten/histamine/lactose intolerances), I really think this is the best dietary choice for me.

Now, I’m wondering if the paleo diet is a good choice too for endurance athletes. I can burn between 800-1500 calories a day working out (10-20h a week, 1-2x/day) ; I do HIIT, long Z1 runs or cycling, resistance training. I’m mostly wondering if by eating maybe 200g carb a day (veggies, fruits mostly) I’ll be able to sustain my training. The way I understand things, if I’m well fat-adapted my body should naturally switch to burning fat (i.e. producing ketones) when my expenditure exceeds my carb intake. So I’m neither ""low carb"" nor ""high carb"". Is that a danger zone or is it perfectly viable?

I’m asking because right now I’m actually pretty much in an overtrained state (taking it easy for a couple days/weeks), I pushed quite hard through summer but also switched from strict keto to this more liberal ""near-paleo"" diet I’m eating right now at about the same time. I highly suspect it’s really my training load that was the problem, and want to exclude my diet as a possible source of problems (i.e. if others succeed with high training loads on paleo, then it would mean my training load was the only problem).

So, do others succeed with this low-to-medium carb intake on paleo while training this much?",1598390090

Paleo,[discussion] reflections that may be of interest to some on my experience eating traditional Vietnamese diet (almost paleo expect for rice). Particularly want to discuss ratio of macros.,"I've been experimenting with different diets throughout my life; adjusting ratios of macronutrients trying different variations of paleo, high fat low carb, high protein, pescatarian.. adding and eliminating dairy, wheat sugar ect ect.. and also spent long periods not watching what I eat at all.

However one experience really pleasantly caught me be by surprise. How good I felt eating Vietnamese food for 6 weeks. 
When I arrived in Vietnam and had my first meal, a roadside stand selling noodles. It consisted of a smallish portion of rice noodles, a small amount of cheap, fatty, sinewy chunks of chicken, some sort of congealed blood pudding thing, in a rich garlicky, salty fatty broth (which I think may have had blood in it). topped off with heaps of uncooked, tangled fresh wild herbs (usually coriander, water-cress, sometimes mint and local stuff I couldn't identify). throughout my time there I ate almost exclusively variations of the same constituent ingredients, but made with different fatty meats and fish. 

It was absolutely delicious, but at first I felt sort of worried that I'd feel crappy living off this for the next 6 weeks. it sort of defied my own ideas of what I assumed was a healthy diet. It was low in protein, barley had any legumes, and very little farmed veggies like broccoli, or root veg (sort of low fibre). really high in salt and animal fat, and was I guessed kinda high carb (rice almost every dish). 
However after the first week of eating like this I felt the best I could remember feeling. I had loads of energy and mental sharpness, my skin looked good, I slept great, physically felt better, lost a bit of weight and didn't have any slumps or blood sugar dips or spikes. no digestion issues or bloating whatsoever. reduced anxiety. also didn't get any mosquito bites (b vitamins play a role). 

I was slightly dumbfounded that this diet could have this impact on me. But then I've reflected on it. It was really low sugar, virtually no dairy or wheat (french colonial influenced dishes will have some.) and actually sortof low carb when you consider the portion of rice and the absence of sort of dense veggies. low in seed oil (suet and lard often used. and importantly really good readily absorbed micronutrients and minerals in the rich salty, fatty broths, the cheap cuts of meats, offal, fish. and the wild herbs uncooked herbs.

So High animal fat, moderate carb, high salt, lowish protein.

Paleo,Is the verdict 100% in that beans and legumes are bad? (things like black and dal),"To my surprise my Dr suggest Paleo to help me lose weight. I had heard of Paleo but didn't realize that it was approved by doctors so after his suggestion I'm giving it a try, and have been doing so for a couple of days. 

His main advice was to cut out all carbs that I can cut out -- so I've tossed the potatoes, rice, bread, noodles, crackers, etc. 

I was hoping I could at least eat black beans (I like them with meat) but it seems that many websites say beans and legumes are ""bad"". I was also hoping I could make Dal -- which I really like.

Her way of doing involved the usual eating as listed in the description of a Paleo diet, doing a little walk and that's it. I tried to tell her that the diet would only work if she incorporated an exercise regime into the diet.

My reason is that the Ancient human spent hours running through fields and forest before wolfing down whatever prey they hunted down, that enormous amount of time spent ""exercising"" combine with the diet is what would make the diet work. Not lay about, walk a bit and eat her way to a super model body.

In an effort to conquer my new skin goal, I have slowly transitioned to a Paleo lifestyle and have been 'strict' paleo + intermittent fasting for the last month. I have also tried to eliminate other potential food sensitivities (eggs). I've been to the dermatologist, estheticians, and tried many topical methods to maintain a clear complexion and I dont believe those to be more than a band-aid.

Paleo,Reverse depression and get natural high,"Hello, I have been doing Aajonus Vonderplanitz diet for 16 months. This diet is no doubt the natural diet for man to eat, and is superior to all other diets. It blows everything out of the water. Okay basically high meat, fermented raw meat gets you high and reverses depression quick. But heres the trick. The bacteria in your colon is responsible for feeding the brain and nervous system, but gets some of the fewest nutrients out of all the systems in the body. Feeding this bacteria is one of the most effective treatments against mental illness. What I did recently with super amazing success is a high meat suppository. Basically an enema except you put it deep enough in your butt to where it doesnt leak out and you let it absorb by rolling your stomach for 5 mins on hands and knees, then your right side with left leg lifted, then left side with right leg lifted. You do this with the black high meat juice. Within 20 minutes I had super high energy, I was really excited, and the rest of the evening and the following days (its been 2 days and i still feel effects), I’ve been happier, more optimistic, i have having brighter smarter ideas, i feel more confident about the future, and cant wait to do it again! I am waiting for more meat to ferment. But I mean this stuff is magic. Its the holy grail. No come down, no side effects. Real energy without drugs. I did about 3 tablespoons then I drank probably 2 tablespoons. Aajonus Vonderplanitz said great things about this like itll make you great athlete, if you do it before u dance youll dance alllll night, it reverses antibiotic damage very quickly, he did 3 ounces of this juice for suppository and was awake for 4 days straight and had sex 5 times a day. I did have trouble sleeping but I only did a small amount, and it was about 5 pm i didnt sleep til like 1:30 am, i usually go to bed at 10 though. This stuff is sooo amazing I wish you to try it. If you want sources of information feel free to ask and Ill direct you to my sources. But the thing that matters is it works and i feel great.

I'm currently testing carb sources and have problems  analyzing symptoms.

Does anyone of you know, when oxalate dumping (symptoms) usually start? I'm aware that this migh differ from person to person, but is it possible that symptoms start 1-2 days after drastically reducing oxalate intake, or is it more like 1-2 weeks? I couldn't find any information on this.

I seem to be doing well on 30% and ~45% fat (I’m trying to do body recomposition so my protein is somewhat higher, but my calories are at a deficit, I’m pushing a BMI of 30) having half my plate as veggies is doing well for me.

Paleo,Raw fermented milk and insulin resistance?,"In context of a diet of otherwise nose-to-tail red meat, fat, eggs and salt, can full-fat raw fermented (so no lactose) dairy in excess cause insulin resistance? 

https://www.marksdailyapple.com/dairy-insulin/

&gt; ""*Both skim and whole milk (PDF) elicit significant insulin responses* that you wouldn’t predict from looking at their protein and carb contents, and the fat in whole milk doesn’t blunt it (maybe non-homogenized whole milk would be a different story… I don’t know). *Cream and butter are not particularly insulinogenic, while milk of all kinds, yogurt, cottage cheese, and anything with casein or whey, including powders and cottage cheese, elicits a significant insulin response.* In one study (PDF), milk was even more insulinogenic than white bread, but less so than whey protein with added lactose and cheese with added lactose. Another *study (PDF) found that full-fat fermented milk products and regular full-fat milk were about as insulinogenic as white bread.*

&gt; What’s going on here? It comes down to *the amino acid composition of dairy proteins, specifically the amino acids leucine, valine, lysine, and isoleucine. These are the truly insulinogenic proteins, and they’re highest in whey* (which is probably why whey protein elicits the biggest insulin response).

&gt; ...If full-fat dairy really did have similarly negative effects on the insulin response [as skim milk] that eventually led to the metabolic syndrome, you wouldn’t see studies showing that people who ate the most dairy fat were at the lowest risk for diabetes. You also wouldn’t see the *high number of epidemiological studies (I know, I know) linking full-fat dairy intake with lower risk of heart disease and stroke, both of which are strongly linked with insulin resistance.*

&gt; *I think it’s more accurate to say that acute insulin spikes are different from chronically elevated insulin levels*...""

About the last sentence -- so maybe milk too often could cause insulin resistance? Or would chronic elevated insulin do it but also acute insulin spikes once or twice a day for months or years could too? Or would acute insulin spikes once or twice a day help insulin sensitivity? Would no acute insulin spikes (and no chronic elevated insulin) from milk be best for insulin sensitivity? 

But are the amounts of those insulinogenic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, lysine, valine) higher enough in milk compared to beef that not drinking raw fermented (so no lactose in combination with the insulin spike) milk several times a day and eating beef instead would be better for insulin sensitivity? The beef has proportionally less of those amino acids, but would the higher proportion of them in milk be enough to reduce insulin sensitivity compared to eating beef instead? About these last two questions:


Amino acids in milk

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4932579/

Scroll down to ""Amino acid profile of casein and whey proteins""

In cow casein:

* valine 54 mg/g

* isoleucine 80 mg/g

* leucine 108 mg/g

* lysine 63 mg/g


* threonine 40 mg/g

* methionine 21 mg/g

* phenylalanine 45 mg/g

* histidine 21 mg/g


In cow whey:

* valine 49 mg/g

* isoleucine 34 mg/g

* leucine 81 mg/g

* lysine 65 mg/g


* threonine 41 mg/g

* methionine 22 mg/g

* phenylalanine 44 mg/g

* histidine 16 mg/g


So, total in the milk:

* valine 103 mg/g

* isoleucine 114 mg/g

* leucine 189 mg/g

* lysine 128 mg/g


* threonine 81 mg/g

* methionine 43 mg/g

* phenylalanine 89 mg/g

* histidine 37 mg/g


**Ratio of totals of valine, isoleucine, leucine and lysine to threonine, methionine, phenylalanine and histidine is 534:250 or 267:125.**

___

Amino acids in beef chuck roast

https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/94/6/2603/4702294

Scroll down to ""Total Amounts of Proteinogenic AA in Beef Cuts""


* valine 44 mg/g (all these are in the dry weight)

* isoleucine 38 mg/g 

* leucine 61 mg/g 

* lysine 66 mg/g 


* threonine 34 mg/g 

* methionine 23 mg/g

* phenylalanine 30 mg/g

* histidine 29 mg/g


**Ratio of totals of valine, isoleucine, leucine and lysine to threonine, methionine, phenylalanine and histidine is 209:116. Milk ratio was 267:125.**

Seems like the difference of amino acid proportions in milk and beef wouldn't be enough for fermented milk to be worse for insulin sensitivity than beef, right?

Paleo,How To Eat Paleo on the Go?,"I've recently adopted the paleo diet and it has helped immensely with my autoimmune problems. I have lasting energy for the first time in months and my symptoms have lessened for the first time in over a year. My only issue is, I work two jobs and often have to eat lunch on-the-go in the car. A lot of the paleo-friendly type wraps and sandwich breads (the only food items that seem to be conducive to eating in the car) are really small and break easily. The tortillas I bought for making wraps are made of almond flour, and when you fold them, they basically tear in half so often, it is a worry that what I am eating may end up in my lap. On the other hand, the wraps are also very small, and it is tough enough to eat one wrap on-the-go, let alone two; hoping for another red light to open the tin foil on the other to even get a bite. The paleo bread is very small and isn't really enough to satiate, I feel. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to combat these problems? I was thinking smoothies, but don't know of many good protein drinks. Sometimes I feel like what I eat doesn't give me lasting energy and I don't know why.

Paleo,Is your paleo food-based or philosophy-based?,"This is a difficult question to word properly, but basically, I see two camps in the paleo community:

1) Food-based: Those for whom paleo simply means eating good, real, natural ingredients, and cutting out processed food, sugars, grains, dairy, etc. 

2) Philosophy-based: Those who take it further, for whom paleo means replicating the reality of the paleolithic era, including cooking/prep methods, timing of meals, balance of food and exercise, etc. 

My first impression of this dichotomy is that those who are ""food-based"" are motivated to eat paleo to lose/maintain weight, while those who are ""philosophy-based"" are 'hobbyist' or 'academic' in their approach (i.e. they're motivated to eat paleo because they're interested in paleolithic human existence or something like that).

I've been Keto for over 5 years.  I've lost 110lbs, labs are great, and I'm in the best health of my life.  That being said, I still feel like garbage.

Primal kitchen chipotle ranch: better than normal ranch but still not my favorite

* ""Health Effects"" section doesn't even start with any benefits nor does it list any. The entire section suggests that it is ""exaggerated"" and based on ""weak data"".
* They cite health experts that claim the diet is a ""myth"", and not a single quote from experts that agree with the diet. 

I usually don't care about stuff on the internet but this is a very blatant and obvious attack on our philosophy, especially when the veganism page hardly acknowledges any flaws in its own diet. If others are willing to do something about this, I am absolutely willing to contribute and make this a more accurate representation of the paleo/primal diet, especially for commoners who come to Wikipedia for objective information. We could potentially improve the health/lifestyles of countless Americans if we put our heads together. PM me if interested.",1594572214

Paleo,Can fruits slow down weight loss?,"Hey guys, new to the sub :)
I have been doing Paleo for about 2 weeks now
But haven’t seen any major weight change if at all. I remember going Paleo about 1.5 years ago and even being aa restrictive as I am now (was eating dairy low fat back then) and saw amazing results of weight loss - around 15 kg shed in just 3 months or so(!!)
I didn’t almost any fruits back then important to note.

Now after having 8-9 kg creep on me during almost a year of loosing focus on health, I decided to get back on the saddle and deepen my Paleo to be more strict. 
I don’t eat dairy now at all. No grains at all no legumes. Mainly red meat, chicken, salmon, lots of veggies and fruits. And 90% dark chocolate maybe 2-3 cubes a day? Sometimes not even 1.

And the weight has been steady on me - could fruits be the case and would you consider stopping eating fruits? In addition could be the fruits I ate are not Paleo friendly? 

I ate Pink lady apples, Pineapple (frozen for smoothies with Spirulina) apricots, mandarins, peaches and grapes (black and white) 

Would love your thoughts - I am in the hunt for 10kg of lost weight and can’t seem to figure out what am I doing wrong in my paleo diet. 

Thanks 🙏🏼😊",1594273651

Paleo,[question] high a1c on low carb diet,"hi, ive recently gotten some blood results back that say i have an a1c of 5.3. within 'clinical' range, but still an unhealthy number for blood sugar and ive been low carb during that time. ive actually had an unsatisfying a1c for quite a while but its been creeping up.i workout in some way or another every day by walking my dog, yoga, drums, weights, hiit. i workout 'hard' 4 days a week with hiit,running,jump rope, or weights. i have been eating under 100g of carbs for a few years. recently i went from 3 meals a day to two and i thought that would help but it seems to have raised my a1c a bit. by the way i check my blood sugar after every meal and its usually around 100-110 sometimes under 100 at the 2 hour mark. i eat around 2500-2600 calories on hard workout days and probably 2200-2400 on regular days. most of my calories are at breakfast around 9 am. this is about 2000 calories most days, some days a bit less like 1800. i eat about 50 carbs at breakfast but try not to go past that. then at dinner, around 6, depending on if i worked out or not, i eat between 15-30 or so. so i dont usually go past 80 carbs or so on any day, with no more than like 20g of sugar. less than 50g net carbs. any ideas on why this is happening?",1594122450

Paleo,[Discussion] Not sure if I have leaky gut or what.,"For dinner I had 3/4 lb of beef plus fried cabbage with no issues.  2 hours later I ate 2 grapes and then felt reflux pain.  Then I had some decaf coffee with half and half, that gave me some reflux.  Then I had a small amount of Lilys chocolate, that gave me joint pain in hands.  

I'm trying to figure out what is wrong with me.  My main symptom is fatigue that started 5-7 years ago.  I've been slowly getting more fatigue since then.  I think it's because of poor sleep.  I had in in lab sleep study 4 years ago, negative, 0 AHI.  1 at home sleep study 8 months ago 5.5 AHI.  I was convinced I had UARS.  I end up getting nasal surgery to fix my chronic nasal swelling and sinus infection.  I can breathe better out of my nose but still keep getting more tired.  I bought my own bilevel cpap machine with no success.  Another at home sleep study showed AHI of 8.3.  I'm 5'11"" 155lbs.  Joint pain in mostly my hands the past year that mostly comes on with certain foods.  

Tried quitting caffeine for sleep improvement with no help.  I still do consume caffeine but it's ~100mg a day and before lunch so I don't think that is the issue.  I've been trying to get more exercise, reducing blue light, fitness tracker, intermittent fasting, white noise machines, weighted blanket, etc with no improvements in sleep.  My diet varies but is paleo / keto / carnivore.  I have a history of reflux, GERD, bruxism, anxiety and headaches.  Blood tests come out normal, H pylori test negative, skin allergy test negative.  Have been to several doctors, 2 immunologist and 2 sleep doctors with no improvements.  I'm now seeing a functional medicine doctor.  First appt told me to increase exercise, eat more bone broth and fermented foods.  Plus he gave me desiccated adrenal, digestive aid and ginseng astragalus.  Any ideas on what might be wrong with me?

Paleo,"[Question] For those that have people in your household not on paleo, how do you manage sticking to it long term?","A bit of context: a few years ago I went on strict Paleo and had a lot of success with it. Over the years since then, I’ve tried to stick to Mark Sisson‘s 80% rule, but it’s a slippery slope (there’s been times where I was off completely) and my weight has slowly crept back up. I’m following strict Paleo again now, but it’s so “clunky” making it work since I’m the only one in my house who wants to eat this way. 

I actually love eating Paleo. But I find the most challenging part is adapting it to the real world. My husband is very supportive but is not on the diet, and it’s challenging to schedule meals together. 

I’m curious if anyone has had success long term with paleo while someone else in your family isn’t on it. How did you make it work so that it wasn’t burdensome?",1593181016
Paleo,"Salads are not paleo, in my opinion","Did people eat vegetables historically? Absolutely. Did they eat 5 cups of lettuce in a single meal, along with half a cucumber, half a bell pepper, a carrot, etc? No way. It's way too much fiber. Paleo man was about getting efficient calories. No, he wasn't eating white bread, but he was definitely eating natural foods that had net positive caloric content.

If you want to eat lettuce leaves as garnish, perfect. If you want to eat a salad because it reduces your calorie intake, and you are trying to lose weight, then that's fine.

If you try to eat salads because you are just trying to be as healthy as you can be, and you want to eat the closest thing to your ancestral diet, then I think you're on the wrong track by eating salads.

Paleo,[Question] Intermittent fasting not working for me anymore - what next?,"I have been following a ketogenic or near-ketogenic paleo/primal diet for about five years now. I do eat fermented dairy but otherwise follow all the paleo do's and don'ts. I'm pretty strict and seldom ""cheat."" I've had great results. About two years ago now, I added 16:8 intermittent fasting, and for a while I had great results with that too. A few months ago I moved my eating window to earlier in the day for the sake of better sleep (used to eat noon - 8pm, now eat 9am - 5pm). Sleep did improve.  
However, recently, I've noticed that in the morning I feel jumpy and am \*very\* sensitive to caffeine, particularly right when I wake up. Like, less than half a cup of coffee and I can feel my pulse going up uncomfortably. Also, the other day I tested my blood sugar and was very surprised to find that it was 98mg/dL, which just seems high considering the way I live my life.

So I looked and found an article by Chris Kresser in which he suggests that some people experience cortisol and blood sugar dysregulation as a result of IF (cortisol would explain my morning jumpiness I think). He advises that people who feel this way should ditch IF and try eating moderate portions every 2-3 hours. Tbh I feel like I would enjoy this more, but it goes against a lot of what I've learned about nutrition/health/longevity over the last few years, and I worry I would put on weight.

Best $1 you can spend (Amazon Kindle edition) for a few hours of enjoyable reading and perhaps a path forward for training your brain to live more naturally as well.

I am shooting out a theory with no research to back this up. Tell me your thoughts on classist hierarchy as it relates to diet and whether this is correct:

Poor, lower class: lots of grain, carbs, relying on starchy foods

Middle class: large scale or family scale organic vegetable and fruit gardening. This does not include the expensive hyped up commercial vegan products (i.e. Vegannaise) that glamorize veganism.

Heavy meat and dairy: Upper middle class and higher.

Obviously, modern intervention and social structuring has changed this. But I'm asking about historical times (can't put a date on it). I always heard that meat was reserved for the aristocrats during such times.

All that being said, if we go based off the theory that diets should accommodate lifestyle, what would be the ideal diet for someone who works an 8-hr desk job (sitting down most of the day), drives a car to work, and perhaps only gets 30 min of gym exercise per day (if even that).",1590861956

Paleo,[Question] Fork in the Road,"Hello Paleo Friends!  


I need to advice - I am at a crossroads. Here’s a little background. I have been doing Keto since January 27th. I have had a great experience, I’ve lost 19lbs (weight loss was my initial motivation) I have more energy, I’ve fixed a lot of my “tummy troubles” the list goes on.  For about a month I haven’t lost any weight and I’ve seen the scale go back and forth about 5 lbs (obviously totally normal)  


Here’s where it gets interesting. I got sick last week not covid thankfully, (I was tested.) During the week I was sick I let myself eat what I wanted, but didn’t go wild. I’ve been feeling great again since Monday, so I stopped eating “junk” and started paleo. (Mainly because I still had fruit left over from when I was feeling sick)  


Does anyone have any experience switching from (strict) keto to paleo? My main motivation now  is overall health, but I do still wish to lose more weight, I am ever so close to leaving the “overweight classification” according to my bmi (which I know isn’t everything but I digress)  


TLDR  
\-Started keto and liked it (lost 19lbs in 4months)

Paleo,"[Question] Bowel movement issue, hard stool.","I'm following the strict version of Paleo, on top of that I try my best to keep my carbs below 20 so I can be in ketosis.

The problem here is that my stool is always hard, bowel movement is twice a week (Which is normal for keto I believe). The color is dark greenish.

Note that there is no pain or any discomfort, so I don't know if this is considered ""constipation"".

I eat mostly organ meat (Not grass-fed) such as beef heart, kidneys, testicles, sometimes egg yolks, hake fish and lean beef steak.

Fat sources are mainly beef fat trimmings and olive oil. I try to keep them at a 2:1 fat to protein ratio.

Plant food are only these: Kale, green and red cabbage, kohlrabi, cauliflower, thyme, mint.
Rarely eat any fruit.

The folks on r/keto told me to supplement on fiber and magnesium, but I'd rather solve this the natural way, meaning without pills.

And I'm not sure if this is supposed to be considered normal to have hard or mildly hard stool on a paleo diet?",1590244684

Paleo,[Question] What are some good sources of (low glycemic index) carbs on paleo?,"Hey everyone,

So I just started eating paleo today, lol. I’ve tracked my macros so far and will end up being pretty low on carbs. From what I understand, paleo is intrinsically lower carb. But, I don’t like the idea of only consuming ~100 grams, which is where I will be at the end of the day. So far I’ve eaten egg, avocado, berries, bell pepper, carrot, cucumber, kale, spinach, sunflower/pumpkin/chia/hemp seeds, almonds and coconut water (among several other things).

So aside from these foods, what is something/are some things I could eat to get my carb intake up a bit (preferably lower glycemic index)? I’m also coming out of some disordered eating so I’m trying to eat quite a bit of each macro, carbs included!

Paleo,[question] Accidental Paleo/Primal— not sure?,"I am not sure if this is the right tag. If not— just kill this.

I seem to have accidentally found paleo/primal, or some space between paleo, keto, and gluten free. Trying to process it as my “ideal” dream diet has always been grain heavy. Based on an upbringing in a Mediterranean/Arab adopted family, and from my time as a vegetarian. Once hardcore as macrobiotic.

I am generally healthy. By that I mean no chronic/acute diagnostic codes. But for as long as I can remember, my health has collapsed when I have tried to “tighten it up” and move to a more grain based diet. Or when I would just give up and be a whatever-vore and eat what presented itself. By my health collapsing I mean joint pain, stiffness, hives &amp; itchies, flaking skin, horrible GI distress. From GERD to so bad it was thought I had ulcerative colitis.

After these bouts of my health falling apart, I seem to just instinctually modify my diet. Really some space between paleo, keto and gluten free. It’s not something I’ve particularly researched. It just happens. 

After this last bout I went to the doctor, and had a bunch of labs done. I was so exhausted, fuzzy thinking, itchy, and in pain from sore joints and stiffness, I couldn’t drive a few hours to meet friends. The labs came back negative except for an inconclusive inflammation marker. The doctor was *shrug*. 

So I have been using my body as a lab. Trying different diets, and the going back to my fall back. First test, I made a tray of extremely healthy baked ziti. Then “healthy” sandwiches like humus in pita. Then fake gluten based meats. I ended up in such pain that it was a struggle to get into child’s pose to stretch out my aching back— and that is as passive as it gets. And I almost had to have surgery for an abscess.

Needless to say, I’m sticking to this fall back diet. It’s something between paleo, keto, and gluten free. I am not sure. I have just landed here. My medical people say this is all in my head, as I have been here before. I’ve been tested for food allergies and sensitivities and I’m fine. Jump to corn, rice. Maybe not as bad, or as bad as quickly— but not a good outcome. Beans too. I made huge pots of beans and lentils in the week or ten days before I got this abscess. I have even tried a bunch of fungicidal herbs, even pharmaceuticals. No matter. My labs are always negative for yeast, parasites, and so on.

It’s weird. 

Other people find themselves randomly in the paleo camp not looking? Other people get here from the opposite end of things— vegetarian, vegan, crackervore, etc.? Other people have their medical people tell them they are nuts?

Had a couple pork chops and about a 1/4 pound of cabbage and garlic kraut for lunch. Feel great. Not hungry between meals and I’m shedding weight comfortably.",1589651998

Paleo,Cutting Calories The Easy Way,"&amp;#x200B;

In theory, working from home should give you more time to spend on developing healthier habits such as preparing nutritious meals, moving more and getting extra sleep. 

However, I feel it would be very ignorant of me to assume this is the case for most people.

Maybe you haven't quite got into a routine yet and are still finding yourself working/stressing more and moving less.

Here's some real examples of how to reduce your calories without changing the food you eat. 

(This is actually what I eat, well not the full days menu - in case you were wondering).

Meal Example 1:

I'd usually eat 6 eggs for breakfast with 2 handfuls of chopped kale and a handful of blueberries and raspberries.

**Calorie Cut Adjustment** \- remove 1-2 eggs.

Meal Example 2:

I'd usually have 2 pieces of fruit as my morning or afternoon snack.

**Calorie Cut Adjustment** \- Choose only 1 piece of fruit OR half of both pieces(save the other 2  half pieces for tomorrow).

Meal Example 3:

I'd usually eat a couple of pieces of dark chocolate as a pre-workout.

**Calorie Cut Adjustment** \- swap the dark chocolate for a scoop of creatine with water or an espresso (both have very little calories at all).

Meal Example 4:

I'd usually eat two fist-sized portions of protein, 2 hand-sized portions of vegetables, 1 cupped-size portion of carbs (rice/bread) and 2 thumb-sized portions of healthy fats for dinner.

**Calories Cut Adjustment** \- remove the cupped sized portion of carbs or 1 of the thumb sized serving of fats.

So, hopefully you see this as a pretty simple and easy tactic to implement.

As with anything nutrition-related there are always exceptions.

If you are not eating enough protein as it is, then don't calorie cut your protein consumption.

Similarly if all you eat are god damn potato chips then probably start there ;)

so I switched to paleo a few months back and I've ate nothing but fruit and meats.

I got a lil tempted and I decided to eat a cookie, bam my tongue gets a swollen and spotted and the roof of my mouth starts burning.

odd but I forget about it and eat a bowl of special k, same reaction.

I forget about it and eat a slice of cake.

burning lips and swollen roof,

I ate all these things no issue before paleo, now I have allergic reactions to everything I gave up on?

Paleo,[Question] Gestational Diabetes,"Hi everyone, I've been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and I'm wondering if any of you have experience with that.

I'm asking because I'm really confused about the information I'm getting - when my midwife told me my diagnosis, she suggested some things such as eating sandwiches with a lettuce wrap instead of bread. I immediately thought of the primal diet because I did that years ago and really loved it. But then my diabetes specialist gave me a sample meal plan that is almost identical to how I've been eating already. It says *not* to do low-carb, and that I should be eating at least 150 grams of carbs per day, only eat whole wheat products, and no sugar, which I was already doing. I'm afraid to bring this up because I don't trust the medical industry and I'm worried they will just put me on insulin. I'm considering just switching over to primal and not telling her. 150 grams of carbs sounds really high to me - isn't the whole idea of diabetes to *decrease* your carb levels because your body can't handle them?

In my birth class, I actually learned that following a low-carb diet can give you a false positive on the glucose screening because your body cannot handle that glucose drink if you're used to eating a protein and fat based diet. So I'm hoping that maybe that's the case for me and when I start testing my blood sugar I won't see it spike.

I live in New York City and my parents who are older live with me so I can't risk going outside to get meat and produce during this epidemic + Instacart, Amazon Prime Now, etc. have limited availability. As a result, it's been difficult for me to eat Paleo (especially since we have a whole bunch of my childhood favorites - instant ramen, Chef Boyardee, etc.).

Coincidentally, my friend Jason was doing some research and found some farms that were delivering straight to our doors! We thought other people were probably having the same problem so we made a simple database of farms that are currently in-stock and delivering straight to people's doors!

We currently have 32 farms that ship meat nationwide with 1 farm that ships produce (more coming soon!). If you have any suggestions, whether it's farms to add or ideas, please PM me!

Paleo,[Blogspam]Made An Excel Sheet For Nutrition Database Of Common Foods,"Hello Friends,

We often need to check and compare nutrients in food items, for which I had made an excel sheet of nutrition of common food items, based on data from USDA. I had been using it since quite a while and thought it might be helpful to others as well. Currently, it contains vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy, eggs, nuts, seeds, fats and oils. I might also add grains, herbs and spices in future.

Using this database one can quickly check which foods are high in which nutrient. To sort a column in Google Sheets, select that column, right click on it and select Sort sheet (Z-A or A-Z). For example, there are several suggestions that Zinc is important for immune system, one can see that Nuts and Seeds high in Zinc are Watermelon Seeds, Hempseed, Pumpkin Seeds; and Meats high in Zinc are Oysters.

Please check it out here and feel free to use and share as you like:

Paleo,[Question] Potato Salad Health Improvement?,"Alright paleo peeps I need your help on this one.

So, for the past six months been feeling like I am completely out of gas. I assumed something was straight up missing from my diet but got blood checked and though my vitamin D and iron was a little low but otherwise good to go. As a result, I just did a few common sense things like more water, more sleep etc. etc.

Cut to a couple of weeks ago where I wake up one morning feeling like I could seriously take on the world. No specific reasons as to why/how I was suddenly feeling better but it was a legit change in energy/focus/strength etc. However, a couple days later, I was right back in my ""slump"". Naturally, I considered those couple of days feeling on the up and up as a bit of a fluke but then the following weekend the same thing happened: a couple of days feeling like a million bucks. Then it went away again! Now, I was thinking it had to do with sleep being on the weekend but I'm getting the exact same amount every night really =/- 30 min or so.

At that point I figured it absolutely had to be something I was or was not eating so systematically went through the past couple weeks of my online food orders and grocery receipts. Turns out, there is a common thread.

Potato Salad.

I know, I'm shaking my head as well but during instances of ""clarity"" I had potato salad the night before. So, on Friday, I tested my theory and sure enough I feel amazing this weekend post Friday night potato salad gorging.

The only question I have now is: what in the hell is in this stuff that is making me feel 110%?!! Is potato salad known for having high amounts of a particular vitamin, mineral, magical ingredient?

Any insight would be amazing.

Thanks!",1587342955

Paleo,MyFitnessPal thinks I’m not eating enough...,"Hey! So. I am entirely new to Paleo. I mean, I did my first day yesterday new. 

In lockdown I’ve been using MyFitnessPal to help me with weight loss. I’m set on 1,200 calls a day, therefore, which I’ve been using. 

Yesterday’s allocation was 1,555 due to exercise. 

I had a great food day. I had large amounts of dense green vegetables, some meats, nuts, I tried butter coffee which was weird but good, a nice sauce on my chicken in the evening. Generous coconut oil allocation in there. I did not crave sugar. My primary reason for trying Paleo is to try and shake the demon sugar. It worked beautifully. I was not hungry.

I completed my day on MyFitnessPal only to be told: you’re not eating enough. I was 560 calories under my allocation. 

Well that never happens! I’d be hungry at that level of consumption normally. I was perplexed. So I asked Google about calorific intake on Paleo. It didn’t have much to say, so I’m asking here:

Should I have eaten more? Is it normal to see a calorific drop when eating according to Paleo, will this be a thing?  Is it possible it’s a transitional thing and my calorie intake will go up later??",1587285188

Paleo,[Question]: Request : meals that you can ‘hide’ meat in for a recent ex vegetarian,"
Hi!
I’m newly into researching paleo. A couple of months ago I decided I would eat meat after not eating meat for 4.5 years. I am still struggling with actually getting meat into me because it grosses me out. The easiest way I’ve found is fast food but this is obviously not healthy. The easiest meat I can eat is McDonald’s cheeseburgers. I’ve tried making burgers at home but they’re too meaty. I just don’t like the chunks of thick meat. I’m trying to psychologically wrap my head around meat still so I’m trying to ease myself in. 

Does anyone have any ideas for meals I can hide meat into or make it seem less like meat? 

I’ve tried:
- lasagna (was ok)
- kfc (gross and unhealthy)
- chicken wraps (okayish)
- tenders (no)
- homemade burgers (no)
- homemade schnitzel (no)
- bbq chicken (okay)

Thank you for any ideas you have!",1586788558

Paleo,[Question] I'm at a loss regarding what to eat.,"I'm suffering from mild depression. Compared to what many others have to endure, it's probably not too bad, but it's still bad enough that it makes me unable to do and experience the things I want to do in life. I've had short periods in my life when I felt great, so I know my body is capable of such feelings. Have tried many things to improve my health, but few things have had even a noticeable effect. Doctors have been a waste of time so far.

I've been noticing an increase in allergic symptoms over the last few years. I now struggle to breath through my nose due to how clogged it feels. I've also noticed a strong correlation between allergic symptoms and general health. This points toward my health issues being caused by allergies/intolerances. Thus, I've been interested in diet for a while now, but I can't find a way to eat that works for me. Maybe someone else has been in a similar situation and can recommend something.

My current diet is something like: Meat, dairy and starches (mostly rice/potatoes). I don't care about variation, I could probably eat the same meal every day. My sense of taste is sensitive, if something tastes a little off, I can immediate detect it and it makes it hard for me to eat it. I can't force myself to eat something that tastes bad, in the long run I'll end up undereating instead. I'll list some attempts of changing my diet and how it went:

Multiple attempts at meat only: These have been the most successful when it comes to health. I noticed some positive changes for allergic symptoms and mental health after only a few days. Unfortunately, all attemps at a carnivorous diet has been unsuccessful due to other reasons. Finding fatty enough cuts of meat is almost impossible (plus expensive). I've tried buying pure animal fat and add it to the meals, but it always tasted bad. My best attempt was with bacon only, but I ended up getting so bored of it that even a few months later I can't stand the taste of bacon. At least this suggests that I tolerate meat well and should continue eating it.

Keto: Relying heavily on dairy as a source of fat. I did this for about a month before stopping. It was a while ago, so I can't quite remember all the details, but it didn't have have a noticeable effect (except for losing some weight). This somewhat suggests that dairy could be an issue.

Dairy-free: The last thing I tried. To be fair, I only did it for a few days, and ended up stopping so I wouldn't have to throw out all dairy from my fridge. Instead of dairy I added olive oil to the food. It ended up tasting pretty good, though when I tried only meat + olive oil it ended up tasting bad. Unfortunately I didn't notice any change in health during this time.

Fasting: I did a two day fast, hoping to see a reduction in allergic symptoms at the end. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, suggesting that it could take longer than two days for them to clear up.

So now I'm kinda stuck, I don't know what to do. My requirements for a diet is basically: Palatable enough, avoids every unknown food allergy/sensitivity, nutritionally complete, and not too expensive. Any suggestions what to try next?",1585490354

Paleo,[Question] Can the paleo diet improve allergy (sinusitis) symptoms?,"I've had chronic sinusitis for a few years, worse in the last year or so, which has resulted in obstructive sleep apnea. Most mornings I wake up with a severe headache, puffy eyes, extreme fatigue, and often am unable to breath through my nose. It feels swollen shut. Last year I had two surgeries for deviated septum, nasal polyps, turbinates, and adenoids, and I didn't notice any improvement. I've also tried all nasal steroids and decongestants, prescription and OTC, and still no change. I recently had allergy testing--my skin reacted to everything (suspected Dermatographia), so they sent my blood off for lab testing. Everything came back negative. However, I recently looked back at my results and saw they only tested for environmental allergens. Made me start thinking about what foods I'm eating that might be contributing to my sinus inflammation. I saw a lot of information online about the paleo or autoimmune protocol diets and decided I would try the paleo diet out. I was already dairy free and ate minimal gluten, but I'm hoping that further cutting out grains (I previously ate a lot of oats and quinoa) and legumes will make a significant change. I have a few questions: 

1. Has anyone had any success with paleo for sinus inflammation specifically? If so, how soon should I be able to notice any change? 
2. How do I know if there's not something more specific (histamine foods, nightshades, eggs, nuts, etc.) that's causing the inflammation. I don't want to cut everything out, but I want to figure out what exactly is the problem. 
3. Do inflammatory reactions to things like grains, legumes, or specific vegetables come up on any other kinds of allergy testing? 

Just feels like I'm taking a shot in the dark with this, but I'm desperate to start feeling better. I'd appreciate any suggestions or experiences you've had.",1585188467

Currently, I've been 2 weeks Paleolithic Keto, and I'm also following Thomas Delauer's Gut Reset Protocol. So, I was keto the first week, then I did ADF (24 hours fasting following by normal eating) for the second week, and now I'm just doing keto again for 2 weeks before reincluding prebiotics and Mark's Probiotic (Truth be told, I'm 24 hours into a 72 hour fast). What kind of exercise should I be doing right now and for the rest of the protocol? When I reintroduce carbs, how much should my fats be lowered by?

Paleo,[Question] Were our ancestors low-carb?,"I've been thinking about this recently... the Masai and Inuit are often cited as 2 low-carb cultures but there's not many others I've heard of, apart from a few scans of bones showing that some of our ancestors ate mostly animals. On the other side there's quite a few traditional cultures which ate and still eat high carbohydrate - Okinawans, Kitavans, the Tsimane, Tukisenta, Kuna and the Japanese, all of which seem to be quite healthy and ate/eat from 65-97% of their calories from carbohydrates. Another common proposition is that during the Ice Age we wouldn't have had access to plant foods, so must have eaten low-carb, but I've read that most Europeans moved to the Mediterranean throughout this period so would've had more access to plant foods/carbs.

I can understand that if our ancestors did eat low-carb that switching to this kind of diet could help to prevent some modern diseases, I'm just not sure about the actual evidence of this. I have no agenda either way, I've even eaten low-carb for years and went zero-carb to the point that plants no longer seemed like food, yet still wasn't convinced it's optimal for humans. I'm interested in any of your thoughts on this. :)",1584704396

Paleo,"[Discussion] Making ""High meats"" safely?","Hey everyone, sorry if I am posting in the wrong sub, but I will give it my best shot.

Just  for a little backstory, I have been struggling with moderate to severe  depression for the past few years. I have tried almost everything under  the sun, nofap, cold showers, meditation etc. and yet it clearly has not  helped me much. To be honest, I am starting to get a bit desperate so I  am thinking outside of the box, please excuse me if I sound like I  don't vaccinate my kids :)

Today, I  bought some fresh beef rump steak from a good butcher. I tried a little  piece raw and it seemed to taste pretty good. I got a normal glass jar  and cleaned it with boiling water and baking powder, then I added the  meat in. Its been about 3 hours now and its sitting at room temperature.  I am supposed to air it out every day to prevent botulism [according to this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DIdHuskhKE)  however it made me wonder how safe it actually was seeing as the  measures to prevent this seem half-assed compared to the possible  implications.

Me and my family  have fermented many things. I have made my own sourdough from nothing  but flour, made my own pruno and pickled gherkins. My relative simply  adds the gherkins with some garlic, herbs, and salt and just leaves it  there for about 2 weeks; It is the closest thing to which I am trying to  replicate however it makes me wonder if I should add the same salt  solution to mine. I actually have the juices from these gherkins with me  so I might try adding them with the meat in a seperate container.

...And  yes, I know I really shouldnt be doing this as per official advice.  However from what I have read from these sometimes crazy people \*cough  sv3rige\* is that butchered organic meat is better than standard mince or  cheap meats due to less diseases due to the fact that thousands of cows  are kept in  an inclosed area and butchered by the same blades.

With coronavirus making it impossible to go out and easily shop, I wanted to make a board of support for us to share good recipes, Paleo-friendly brands that have long shelf lives, etc.

Also, if you've not been strictly Paleo because of stress, **it's okay. Forgive yourself.** These are uncertain times. Don't make it an excuse, but don't hate yourself for making a few mistakes.

I ate wheat for the first time in eight years a few nights ago, and though my skin had a breakout, I was fine and didn't die or fall off the bandwagon. No desire to eat it again.

**Be fucking kind to yourself.**

If you have kids without allergies, you can give them pasta or whatever and you're not a bad parent. They're kids. When I was a kid, I ate straight carbs and candy every day and burned through them quickly. I have been strict Paleo for almost seven years at 26 years, so it's not like it permanently affected my taste preferences.

Want to eat rice or cheese? Consider those Paleo for now, they're healthy-ish and can help stretch out a meal.

Now that that's out of the way...

A good shelf-stable recipe: 1/2 canned pumpkin beaten heavily with one egg, put cinnamon (a LOT) and maple syrup or some other sweetener (just a little bit) in it, and microwave it for like 3 to 7 minutes, depending on how you want the consistency to be. 2 to 3 minutes, it's a souffle, 7, it's like bread.

Jovial pasta and tomato sauce make for a great healthy pasta dish with lots of lycopene.

Hello everyone,

We are a group of researchers at the University of Toronto, Canada spearheading the OROS (Outcome Reporting in Obstetric Studies) Project. Our main goal is to improve health outcomes for mothers and babies in certain pregnancy conditions.

Our current focus of in pregnancies involve women with an elevated BMI/plus-sized (or soon to be) mommies. We need the input of **all relevant stakeholders** when it comes to plus-size pregnancies, and not leave the choice of outcomes entirely up to those who conduct the clinical trials. Thus we are **asking women who have been (or are) pregnant with an elevated BMI, clinicians and researchers who have worked with/had a role in caring for these subset of patients to please participate in our survey.**

It is a **quick and anonymous survey**, which will help clinicians and researchers around the world to not only further understand but better treat and manage these women and their babies. Here is the link, [https://delphimanager.liv.ac.uk/COSSOPP/Delphi](https://delphimanager.liv.ac.uk/COSSOPP/Delphi). Thank you so much for your precious time and input!!

P.S. The OROS website [https://www.obgyn.utoronto.ca/oros-project](https://www.obgyn.utoronto.ca/oros-project) gives additional information on our team and our work.

Paleo,[Question] Books on veganism and vegetarianism (don't kill me),"Strange title for this sub, I know. Here's some background though.

I started eating paleo, oh, maybe 10 years ago after reading ""The Paleo Solution"" by Robb Wolf. I was hooked.

Since then I've dabbled in Paleo/Primal/Keto and I'm still tinkering. I'm adding more dairy as I seem to tolerate it and the quality of it in Sweden is pretty high.

Now for the gist of this post. I've realized I've gotten a bit too ""comfortable"" in my paleo bubble. Sure, I can ""argue"" for why I think a paleoish diet is good for most people, but I struggle not to get too dogmatic or preachy. Also, there are patches and holes in my knowledge I want to fill.

I don't want to be ""that guy"".

One way for me to do this is to better educate myself on opposing viewpoints. I've been bad at reading stuff pro-vegetarian/pro-vegan and basically dismiss it without even looking at it. However, I think that a way for me to better grasp this concept is actually exploring opposing positions as rationally as I'm able to.

So do any of you:

* ...know of any books/materials about veganism/vegetarianism that are seen as a ""staple"" by their respective community?
* ...know of any books/material with a more evolutionary/science-based approach in arguing for a vegan/vegetarian diet?

I want to familiarize myself with the arguments I usually face or sense about this topic, not so that I can get better at ""debating"" (although I admit it is a tempting reason) but rather better understand the discussion from both viewpoints and thus, bettering my own understanding.

Paleo,[Question] Fruit Based Paleo Minimizing Meat?," Hey there,

I've eaten a paleo diet for the past few years and have gone low-carb/keto and found that burning fat as my main energy source doesn't really work optimally for me, so then introduced more 'safe starches' which for some reason I can't tolerate well. The only other option then is fruit which I do tolerate well and enjoy eating. I've noticed since eating plenty of fruit I'm losing the taste for meat, to the point that even a steak is becoming unpalatable, so looking to include other animal based foods in my diet for vitamin B-12, zinc etc and looking for ideas. I'm thinking oysters and lighter/less fatty seafood could be good options.

Thanks in advance for any input :)",1582817424

Paleo,[BlogSpam] My Paleo Weight Loss Video,"Hi guys. New to Reddit. I decided to try out Paleo for weight loss. I gained a lot of weight in 2019 due to beer and pizza related reasons. Most of the weight is concentrated around my belly, and that's what I want to lose. 

I enjoyed Paleo at the beginning, but it soon became unsustainable. I was hungry all the time, I would get food comas around lunch time, and meat where I live is extremely expensive. When I say these things, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from going on a Paleo diet, I'm just saying it didn't work for me.

Also I cheated a lot, especially towards the end. I went on a trip to Japan and there was a buffet at the hotel and an open bar. So it was very hard to resist. 

I lost a total of 13 pounds in 7 weeks. I don't think it's that good. I was hoping for a lot more, but then again, like I said, I did cheat a lot. In fact, originally, I wanted to it for 3 months. But I got so sick of eating meat all the time, and depriving myself of any grains. I love to eat rice, pasta, bread, etc... And being unable to eat those things made me really want to go on a carb binge. 

My amazing girlfriend helped me out a lot with filming and ideas, so props to her. I'd love to hear your feedback on this video. Thanks and keep on keeping on.

Paleo,[Question] Normal Carb High Fat longterm?,"Heyho! I‘ve tried Keto long enough and can confidently say it‘s just not sustainable for me - I need a significant amount of carbs longterm to feel good and yes I have a lot of experience with water fasting etc. also my hair was thinning on keto and I had TMJ. And yes I cared about protein intake, electrolytes etc. Also carbs are part of my lifestyle. I enjoy food too much and want to have that freedom to eat pasta and cake when I want. But at the same time, I can‘t eat those foods especially sugar everyday since it would be just disgusting meanwhile. So my body really shows me what it needs - i like to eat fatty meat and eggs after workout, in the morning I like to eat oats and anti inflammatory berries like blueberries - I love veggies etc. so I feel really well after listening what my body needs. So there are no cravings for „bad“ food at all.

So my question is: If I eat a moderate/normal amount of good, complex nutrient-dense carbs like lentils, sweet potatoes, beans, fruits in moderation, etc. and mostly avoid processed foods, sugar, grains, etc. and simultaneously eat good fats from fish, high quality meat, avocado, eggs, etc. and cook with butter and olive oil instead of oxidized fats like rapedeed oil, sunflower oil, etc. - is it okay to consume higher amounts of fats even if I add what most keto people would call a high amount of carbs (let‘s say maybe 200g)?

From what I know it‘s just a problem if you spike insulin too much with simple carbs and simultaneously eat oxidized fats, so a combination of „good“ carbs and „good“ fats + consuming anti inflammatory foods should not be a problem. That‘s what japanese people do, although they don‘t eat so much fat as far as I know.

Can I train my body to work efficiently with ketones and carbs simultaneously by eating like that?",1582564072

Paleo,[Discussion] going against the grain: theory vs bloodwork of (pseudo)grains' antinutrient effects,"Using wild rice as an example of a pseudograin considered relatively healthy, this article discusses the issue and links to further good reads from the paleosphere: 
http://www.surepaleo.com/is-wild-rice-paleo/

As a nutritionist I favour a nutrivore/ancestral diet (big fan of Kresser, Masterjohn, Wolf, Patrick) but I've noticed that in clients I had to put on an AIP/elimination diet, upon reintroducing first basmati and then red/black/wild rice (as they could not handle any tubers yet) into their diet as a primary source of carbohydrates and monitoring their bloodwork for mineral levels throughout, there was no discernable reduction one would expect from the supposed binding of minerals by antinutrients, specifically phytate.

I'd like to delve deeper and discuss whether any of you have monitored your mineral levels on/off grains/antinutrient foods (putting aside the reduction by soaking as a factor for now), as I wonder whatever amount is bound by antinutrients is overcompensated for by those (pseudo)grains rich in minerals like black &amp; wild rice.

Paleo,[Question] How to feel better on paleo,"I’ve, without really realizing, have fallen into a paleo-style diet these last 5 weeks. I haven’t eaten grains and dairy, and I haven’t eaten meat in the last 3 years. I’ve been sticking to whole foods. Generally, I eat eggs in the morning with some roasted red peppers or avocado and spinach, for lunch I have a chickpea soup, tuna salad, or vegan chili, and supper is usually some sort of fish with a side of veggies. I snack on fruits and nuts. I’ve been working out consistently during these 5 weeks as well, 5-6x/week. I’ve also stopped smoking weed and haven’t had any alcohol. 

I have never been able to stay on track with eating well and working out regularly, so I’m really proud of myself. My body does not feel inflammed and I’m starting to see slow muscular changes. Everything should be going well, except that I actually don’t feel the greatest. I am tired a lot, I feel quite weak, I feel a little bit of ‘brain fog’. So my body feels good inflammation-wise, but I feel like my brain is catching up. I hope this makes sense, but I feel like after over 4.5 weeks, I should be over this. Is this normal? How much longer should I be expecting to feel like this? What can I change to feel better?

I had a glass a wine and a piece of cake for my sister’s birthday recently and my stomach did not agree with it anymore. I know that with the inflammation difference alone, I want to stick to this, but I feel very drained. I would really appreciate some advice/guidance!",1581489423

Brussels sprouts are lightly oiled and tossed with salt before taking a turn in the oven to crisp up into golden brown morsels of tastiness. They’re then dressed in a Vietnamese fish sauce vinaigrette that is spicy, sweet, and positively bursting with umami. Finally, they’re finished with a sweet + tart array of fresh citrus and a sprinkle of mint, which results in a dish that is jam-packed full of flavor with texture to spare.

Paleo,Ideal Macros for Paleo? [Question],"Over the past four years I experimented with keto and while I did have success with it, losing 40 pounds twice, I do find it a bit too restrictive which I think is causing me to binge. I am wondering what the daily macros for paleo should look like? For reference I am 5 foot 5 inches and 250 pounds. I did read the newbie info but didn’t find anything about macros. Thank you for any responses in advance.",1580960816
Paleo,"[Discussion] Low Carb, but not Keto, Paleo a Waste of Time for Lifters?","I have a quick question for people who are doing low carb (i.e. around 100g a day or 20-25% of calories) but non-keto diets and also lift. One of my friends told me he thinks it's better to either go all in and do strict keto (i.e. 25 NC a day) or do a normal low fat, high carb diet but not waste time with moderate or just out of ketosis eating plans.

His logic was that keto trains the body to use fats as fuel, low fat allows the body to keep using carbs as fuel, but the non-keto/high-carb plans leave your body stuck in limbo where it has neither enough fat nor carbs to help you recover after a hard lifting session. While he seems to get good results, his claim is a bit anecdotal, so I was wondering if anyone on here can comment on this.

Briefly on me, I lift on a 3 days on-1 day off Push/Pull/Legs schedule focusing on compound movements. As such, I regularly am lifting around 5-6x a week and need to make sure my nutrition is dialed in. I want to do paleo because I generally feel better when eating nutrient dense, minimally processed foods versus keto where I was constantly bloated from all the fat/protein and finding it difficult to have any balance in life with how restrictive the diet was. I'm mostly just looking for help on how to set up my macros so I can recover and continue to make progress in the gym while also living healthier, of course.

Any advice/anecdotes would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1580958862

Paleo,Going Paleo for lent -40 day challenge [Other],"For lent I am going Paleo

This year for lent I am giving up all the bullshit processed food I’ve been consuming. Going to do a full 40 day Paleo diet. 

My current weight is 228 lbs, 6 ft, (M) 
I am hoping to hit under 200 lbs by eating Paleo and exercising 3-4 days a week (HIIT)

5 years ago I was living in Souther California. This is when I discovered Paleo and loved it. I was around 200 lbs then. After adapting Paleo with exercise I got down to 190 and was feeling amazing. 

I had to move back home to the Midwest for work and that’s when it turned for the worse. I will admit I put plenty of excuses in front of me for the weight gain. Mainly it’s because I’m in the Midwest and there are “NO” healthy options. 

California defiantly makes eating healthy easier as it is such a health conscious state. 

My goal here is to prove to myself I can be a paleo successfully where ever I am! 

So I am excited for this journey and restart to my body. Look forward to staring my journey. 

Thanks Everybody!",1580612976

Paleo,Paleo in Vietnam (travel) [Question],"Hi everyone, I've been eating mostly paleo for 2 years now to manage my ulcerative proctitis and all is well for the most part! My digestion is not perfect, some days are better than others, but overall life is good! That being said, I've recently had the opportunity to go live in Vietnam for a few months (something I've always wanted to do) and I decided to take it. I'll be staying in Saigon for a month and Nha Trang for a month.

However, my biggest concern above all is simply how much I'll be able to control my diet. I understand Vietnamese food has danger zones all over the place for us with shitty stomachs -- most dishes have rice/noodles/added sugar/potential water vegetable/contamination/MSG/etc. So I plan to *hopefully* do most of my own cooking while I gain a better understanding of the culture and food options before deciding which options to trust. Has anyone here been to SE Asia recently with a goal to eat paleo who may have a few tips? Will I be able to grocery shop (even if it's inconvenient) like I would do here in America? Meaning are store bought vegetables and meats reliably safe?

I think I'm hoping to be able to say to myself ""okay worst comes to worst we can always grocery shop"". Or something to have peace of mind about food. The other reddit threads I've read seem to say ""GOOD LUCK"", but I'm willing to go out of my way significantly if need be. Thanks for any info!",1579754487

However you define comfort food, it doesn’t have to be unhealthy, ground you to the couch, “I’ll surely regret this later” kind of food. For me, comfort food is usually something warm and hearty that not only feeds the body but the soul too. It’s the food equivalent of a really good book you can’t put down or a Harry Potter 📷 movie marathon. My Cottage Pie with Horseradish Cauliflower Mash fits neatly into this category.

Paleo,[Research],"It is funny  how our modern diet is so far deviated from what we have been eating for 2.5 millions year ago. We ate paleo for millions of years and only ate agricultural products only for few thousand years. Worst of all, the modern , processed diet we eat now is completely new and unnatural.

&amp;#x200B;

One single nutritional guide called ""Dietary goals for the United States"" was released in 1977 to persuade the entire country to low-fat, high-carb diet. This is one of the reasons why the obesity rate skyrocketed since the recommendation was made in 1977. Worst of all, the initial recommendation was to simply reduce meat-intake in order to reduce cardiovascular disease. However, due to the push back from meat industry, the report revised its initial position. Instead of recommending less meat, the report was revised to a general view of recommending ""low-fat"".

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the actual first edition original 1977 document:

[https://archive.org/details/CAT10527234/page/n1](https://archive.org/details/CAT10527234/page/n1)

&amp;#x200B;

You can see the full effect of the damage and discussion of the report here:

[https://opencommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1482&amp;context=srhonors\_theses](https://opencommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1482&amp;context=srhonors_theses)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;McGovern was eventually advised to issue a prepared statement in the interest of the meat industry, during which he stated the report did not explicitly state that meat consumption caused disease, and then went on to say he considered beef to be an excellent source of protein (12). In September 1977, McGovern conceded, against the advice of many committee members and professionals in the nutrition field, to the meat industry and issued a revision to the guidelines, which were printed that December. The amended version changed the recommendation to decrease meat consumption to “decrease consumption of animal fat, and choose meats \[…\] which will reduce saturated fat intake.” The revision of the guidelines harped on the negative effects of dietary constituents, namely total fat and saturated fat, rather than the food products containing them. The meat industry had done its best to protect its own interests, and American doctors began advising dietary alterations per the new recommendations

TL,DR:

We are suppose to eat ancient diet but we forgot that if we don't evaluate the actual history of our human history and diet pattern.  We evolved over 2.5 millions year on paleo diet. 11000 years on agricultural diet. And only 50 years on modern processed diet. No wonder everyone is sick.

I recently just added a bunch of fruits, vegetables and starches into the mix and haven't really noticed any adverse symptoms digestively. In fact, my stools seem to pass much cleaner. It has boosted my mood quite a bit and my creativity and visualization skills seem to be making a comeback. I am markedly more impulsive and less focused/clear headed but it's only been a few days, so I assume some adaption to carbs is taking place.

My diet is still caloricly almost entirely animal proteins and fat (90%). 

I feel like maybe I could benefit from introducing a wider variety of foods for my microbiota. I theorize that I may not have an appropriate group of microbes for fat and protein alone. Not sure though.

My ultimate goal is to solve this brain fog / anxiety that has been plaguing me for really over a decade. If the impulsivity and sort of strange mental state I'm in doesnt improve I'll likely go back to carnivore, but I want to give it some time.",1579064618

Paleo,"[QUESTION] Beginning my Paleo journey, I have questions and need advice/tips, thankyou.","I'm a 6'2 male and weigh around 215, I used to play a lot of sports in highschool (I was 180-185 then) and I was very fit. 4 Years in college has really increased the fat on my body and I'd like to lose that fat. I just started the paleo diet and I'm aiming to get about 1800-2000 calories a day. I understand I will not retain all the muscle on my body, but I'm doing as much as I can (lifting in the gym) to retain some of it. I also play hardcore 5-on-5 basketball after I lift because 1.) I love it and 2.) It's great cardio. I've started working out 5 days a week, and play hardcore, full court basketball 5-6 times a week. My planned diet is: a smoothie in the morning, a chicken salad/rotisserie chicken for lunch/dinner, and snacks such as vegetables and nuts.

Questions:

1. Where should my daily macros be at? (Protein, carbs, fats)
2. How often should I do carb refeeds, and what should my macros look like on carb refeed days? (I understand this question has a lot of answers, but I'd like to hear many perspectives on this).
3. Do you think my calories (1800-2000) are too low for how active I am?
4. I currently have no energy and I feel like \*\*\*\* after just a couple days of doing this. How great is the payoff? Will I feel amazing if I stick to this diet sooner rather than later?
5. What kind of nuts do you recommend are the best for this diet?",1578958628

Paleo,[Discussion] What is your favorite office breakfast?,"I work in an office with a microwave and a toaster oven. My favorite breakfast is sweet potato with a runny egg topped with sliced breakfast sausage. I feel like paleo has made me more creative with eating real food. Before, I never really knew I could make all of these things in my office and I would just eat junk instead.

I start by setting the toaster oven to bake at 375.

Then I microwave half of a peeled sweet potato until soft (usually about 3-4 minutes)

Mash or cut the sweet potato into cubes and put it in the bowl. If the potato seems like it dried out too much from the microwave- I will add a tablespoon of ghee

Crack an egg on top of it and sprinkle s&amp;p on top (I also use Trader Joe's Everything But The Bagel Seasoning)

It takes about 7 minutes for the egg to get runny with the whites cooked through

I microwave some AppleGate Sugar-Free Pork Sausage and then I slice that up and put it on top.

It is easily my favorite breakfast to make and if I don't have any breakfast prepped that I can just throw in the microwave, it is actually super simple to make (provided there is a toaster oven.) You may even be able to do it with just a microwave but I don't think it would turn out the same. What is your favorite breakfast that you can prepare while at work?

From  what I understand, one meal a day may be easier if you are eating in a  ketogenic style paleo diet because fat burns slower and steadier while  glucose from carbohydrates burn off much more quickly and can leave your  glycogen reserves low which cause an energy crash.

Do  any of you eat just one meal per day?  And if so, are you eating a  mainly glucose (carbohydrate) based diet or a fat (ketogenic) based  diet?  And also, why do you choose one meal per day?",1578069886

Paleo,[Question] Are dairy products meant to be consumed by humans?,"Hello, everyone! I have been thinking about dairy products lately and why there is so much pressure by the industry to convince us they are beneficial or even necessary for staying healthy. Sure, I get it, they contain lots of protein and calcium, but cow's milk is 'designed' to feed a baby calf, not a grown-up human being, and has just the right amount of micro-/macro-nutrients and hormones for such a purpose. All mammals, except humans, stop drinking milk when they get older. Yes, I know, humans are also the only species that uses cellphones and reads Reddit, but eating habits and nutrition is something that should come in more natural ways.

I can admit that fermented dairy products contain prebiotics and beneficial bacteria, but such products are based on milk, nonetheless, the stuff that is not intended to be consumed by people in the first place.

Are they such of you who can tolerate dairy with no issues but have decided to cut it just because it is not natural for us?

Paleo,[Question] New to Paleo,"Hi all! I'm new to this subreddit as well as new to Paleo. I haven't formally started yet but I plan to after new year's (because I know the remaining holiday festivities is going to ruin it anyways). 

The main reason I wanted to start is that my daughter has an allergy syndrome that causes her to be allergic to all dairy, eggs, wheat, oats and rice. Most kids outgrow, but it will be around for a couple of years. So she pretty much already is on the Paleo diet, with added beans and quinoa for extra nutrition because she's still a baby. I am tired of making seperate meals for her and my husband and I. I would like to just make one meal that we can all eat.

The second reason is I have done keto in the past and I loved how I felt and I lost tons of weight, but I hated how restrictive it was and how you had to be so careful with carbs from fruits and potatoes. I just want to be healthy with the added bonus of losing weight from all the excess sugars and dairy! But I don't want to sit there counting carbs. 

Anyways I'm posting for advice on the best way to get started. I plan on eating eggs every morning with alternating things like avocado, sweet potatoes and bacon (and making something other than eggs for my daughter). But I am overwhelmed with lunch and dinner options. What are some easy recipes to get started? Preferably recipes that are easy to sub in things like beans and quinoa for my daughter!

Paleo,[Question] Looking for new meal prep options,"I meal prep my lunches for work.  And for the last several years it's worked out. I would cook one day, make five breakfasts, five lunches, I work five days in a row.  But now my schedule is going to get wild for a few months until we can settle back  down.  So I need something different.  I don't have room in the freezer to make and freeze whole meals, I might be able to fit in small portions  of stuff like proteins.

Does anyone have easy cold meals that I can piece meal week to week no  matter how  my days fit together?  I've tried looking and I have a few ideas.  Like a few days of boiled eggs, carrots, pickles, various paleo muffins, salads.  I might be able to cook up and individually freeze  chicken legs  to throw in as a protein.  But I'm kind of stuck on good veggie choices  that can either just be eaten cold or won't take long to  prep up no more than four days worth at a time.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",1577553343

Paleo,[question] Can eating too much protein lead to constipation?,"I have been eating lots of animal protein over the last few weeks, mainly chicken, sometimes beef. There were times I could eat 1/2 of a whole chicken (breast, wings and legs) paired with rice and veggies at one sitting. I know, that is a lot, so I decided to cut down my protein intake several days ago and limit myself to 1 chicken breast a day. I eat lots of vegetables, but can a diet high in protein, at least compared to what I was eating before, result in bowel motility issues? I started eating chia seeds and prunes yesterday hoping maybe they would bring some relief. I would be glad to hear your personal stories if someone has some. Thanks!",1577457328

I have chronic depression and am dealing with super duper side effects from my meds, so I don’t have anything in me right now to prep food with; however, I also know that when I eat better, I feel better.

How do you make eating clean easy for you? Convenience food easy. I’m not trying to do strict paleo, because at this point I just need to start. See my whining below:

I don’t eat anything at all right now apart from supper, so there’s no desire to make food to begin with.

Throwing out all prepared foods the way that someone on every form inevitably suggests isn’t an option, because I have other people to feed and that’s WAY too complicated right now.

No nuts, botanical or culinary, because I hate some and the others hate me; no eggs, although use as a binding agent or a wash is usually okay; no aquatic tasties apart from salmon. Why salmon? I don’t know.

I only need to have clean food for myself, even just one meal a day and some snacks, that isn’t as all-fired complicated as Pinterest makes it when my body makes it complicated enough.",1577026835

Paleo,[blogspam] Pressure Cooker Beef Bourguignon (Paleo),"This Pressure Cooker Beef Bourguignon is the perfect dish to make on cold nights when warm and hearty comfort food is deemed an essential remedy to the dropping temperatures, dinner demands to be eaten from wide deep bowls while curled up on the couch, and a large bottle of red wine is within arms reach.

For those who are unfamiliar, Beef Bourguignon (or *Bouef à la Bourguignon* if you’re extra fancy) is a traditional French beef stew braised in red wine and beef stock, most often complimented with carrots, pearl onions, mushrooms, bacon, garlic, and herbs.

One of the most well-known variations of this classic dish can be found in Julia Child’s staple cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Julia’s version is, simply put, phenomenal. It also happens to be extremely labor-intensive, clocking in around 5 hours from start to finish. Because of the lengthy process, her recipe is suitable for relaxed weekends or very special occasions, but certainly not for the average weeknight.

My variation of a classic Beef Bourguignon takes a modern shortcut, with the bulk of the tenderizing taking place in an electric pressure cooker and a small amount of the residual cooking requiring the use of a sauté pan. My adaptation makes this dish decidedly more friendly for weeknights but stays true to the gorgeous flavors and textures of the original dish.

**Please note the skip-to-recipe button at the top of the post in case you want to skip the cooking advice and get straight to the recipe:**

Paleo,[Other] Paleo for hyperthyroidism/Graves disease,"Hi all,

I have Graves disease, diagnosed exactly last year, December 2018. Of course I'd say I'm around 90% paleo, eating the occasional grains: oatmeal, gluten-free bread, whole-wheat pancakes; and the occasional milk with my tea/coffee. However, I've essentially stopped eating processed food and ordering out thanks to paleo and really increased my intake of veggies. I also never really drank alcohol but did have red wine a couple weeks ago, prior to that I don't remember the last time I drank.

With my change in diet I was able to decrease the strength of my pill from 10mg to 5mg 6 months ago AND I have my fingers crossed that for my next blood test I'll be in remission too. A couple weeks ago my mom commented on how much brighter my eyes look and how the puffiness beneath my eyes has deflated. I feel much better. My metabolism decreased with my pills and I gained 20 pounds (5'3'' 130 lbs) but I'm just working to go back to my original weight.

Paleo,[Other] KNOW Foods - Popular Keto &amp; Paleo Packaged Food Provider - Likely Gone For Good,"Putting this out there for anyone who used KNOW foods in the last couple years. They got pretty popular in 2017, but evidently sales fell through the last two years. They sold a lot of packaged baked goods with chickpea, coconut, and almond flour and were a pretty good place for some pseudo-paleo items. I found them to be a great crutch when I first started; I've since transitioned to a more traditional paleo diet, but the baked goods were great help in the beginning.

They apparently have been deceptive about nutrition facts, essentially outright lying about nutrition content. I know their Allulose-based maple syrup was pulled for that reason a while ago. They apparently undersold the sugar content by several grams; a major no-no as far as the FDA is concerned, and recklessly inconsiderate, considering an item like that might have appeal to diabetics or those with sugar sensitivities.

Ownership has seemed to have all but skipped town, and apparently has not been reachable by any means since October. A BBB complaint claims they owe nearly $500K to suppliers.

Paleo,How do you deal with Dehhydration and Electrolytes? [Question],"Hi guys!

I'm doing Intermittent Fasting and Low Carb. I get lots of calf cramps and some heart palpitations (sometimes I feel my heartbeat strongly and irregular for a second or two).

Some cramps are normal, as I play sports, but I think they shouldn't be as pronounced.

It's nothing serious, but I'd like to correct it sooner rather than later.

I mostly eat meat, fish and green leafy veggies (kale, spinach and aragula mostly).

Maybe I'm dehydrated, but I actually drink quite a lot of water.
Maybe I need sodium, but I salt my food (although it might not be enough due to the water amount).
Maybe I'm lacking potassium or some other stuff, but I thought that was supposed to be present in green leafy veggies, and I eat a lot of those too.
I don't really know what's the problem, so I just end up eating bananas sometimes but I'd like to not rely on them as they are quite sugary.

Maybe I'm being too extreme and I should add some more carbs like sweet potatoes, I dunno.

Have any of you experienced this? What fixed it for you?

And maybe it ain't dehydration or electrolytes, might be something else, dunno.

Paleo,[Question] How is regular refined sugar more detrimental to my health than honey or maple syrup?,"Hi all,

I understand that natural sources of sugar, such as honey and maple syrup, can be sources of antioxidants and minerals and so do have associated health benefits. That said, their sugar content is high, and despite this (to my knowledge anyway, correct me if I am wrong) they are still considered paleo. So my question is what makes refined sugar so much worse? Is it just the comparative lack of minerals and antioxidants? In a recipe that calls for coconut sugar, would I be jeopardising my health by using regular granulated sugar?

I would just assume that “sugar is sugar” no matter the source and should be avoided (excluding whole food sources of sugar). Am I incorrect?

Paleo,"[Question] Your best ""utility"" sauce because I have to use it every meal","Quick explanation is that I have heaps of trouble swallowing because I'm a head and neck cancer survivor. I've been paleo for a month but I'm having a really hard time not choking on the meat portions of the meals. I really need a utility sauce that will allow the meats to slide down and not get hung up. (BTW all your jokes are welcome, I'm solid with my situation. My friends are ruthless so there's nothing I haven't heard.)

I had an extensive surgery called a 'neck dissection' and the end result is a poor ability to force food down. Mostly swallowing for me is allowing the food to drop backwards and down. This means a lot of aspirating if the texture is clingy or rough and there isn't sufficient saucy liquid to allow the food bolus to slide on.

I've been looking at paleo sauces but do you have a recommendation for your all-around fav? I'll need it a lot (almost every meal really) so lower calorie/better for you is important. Taste isn't crazy important and I don't mind if it conflicts with the meat, I just need it to work. My taste is about 40% anyway after the radiation so it's not a big deal. I just need a sauce I can make/buy in bulk and that keeps in the fridge and tolerates a lunch pail.

Does anyone have any advice on reincorporating carbs since my body doesn’t have the proper enzymes to digest them after not eating them? I know you’re not doctors, but I’m just simply asking for tips or pointers.",1574196710

Paleo,[Question] How to not be hungry on Paleo?,"So it's my 14th day on Paleo. Two weeks. I have a love hate relationship with it right now. My digestion is great. I feel like I'm getting more nutrients than I have before, but I'm HUNGRY! I didn't go on Paleo to lose weight. I have a fast metabolism, I'm average weight but on the lower end of average. I just wanted to eat healthier. I ate so much junk before, the only reason I kept my weight was thanks to my metabolism burning off everything. 

I'm staring think that this was a bad idea. With my metabolism so fast I'm having to eat a ton just to be satisfied. I know the typical answer, add more fat. I am though. I cook with grass fed butter or Olive oil. I put olive oil on my greens, I don't trim fat off meat and I eat egg yolks. This evening I ate an entire bowl of this ground beef and sweet potato skillet. Along with a spinach salad in olive oil. An hour later I was hungry so I grabbed a handful of raw mixed nuts. A few minutes pass, I'm still hungry so I fry two eggs in butter. Another hour later I'm hungry again, about to go to bed. I'm frustrated but I eat a banana to try to hold me over until I fall asleep. 

This isn't the fist time I've experienced this. Sometimes I stay full, sometimes I don't. I'm not sure what the difference is, unless I just eat more. I can't afford to buy more than normal portions though. It's like I'm eating for two people when I can only get enough for one. I'm not sure how to combat this. I've meal planned this whole time. But if I eat all my meal plan im are left scrounging the ""snacks"" or eating tommows lunch/dinner. 

I'm tired of being hungry. I've added the fat, but it just isn't enough. This is making me question this diet for myself. Either I starve to death or I lose all my money buying groceries for two. I'm really struggling here and getting off Paleo is a becoming more and more likely. I don't want to, but my stomach growling says otherwise. Any help would be appreciated.",1573795312

Paleo,Snacks and coconut milk,"Years ago I was REALLY in to paleo eating.  I felt amazing, loved it, I had all the meals/snacks/treats/“baked goods”/paleo versions of old favorites DOWN. I was awesome at paleo.....then I stopped.  For various reasons (which now I realize I could have worked around) I had to step away from paleo and eventually made a full stop.  I’m back to the “standard” American diet now.   

BUT!  I’m making a paleo come back!   I have my “meals” down but I’m struggling with snacks!  Of all things.  I can’t remember what I used to eat as a snack.  That, just got home from work and want a quick SOMETHING snack....no ideas.   What do you all eat for snacks?????  

Also has anyone found a good coconut milk for coffee??  When I was super paleo before, I used to get the “green can” of coconut milk from Trader Joe’s.  It was ALL milky liquid, no need to mix, and paleo approved.  Then they stopped having that offered but it was my coffee favorite, no weird separating or mixing it.  It was perfect.  Does anyone know of a canned coconut milk that is ALL liquid, no cream separation, able to pour right out??   I miss this the most.

Paleo,[Discussion] Questions - veganism/switching to paleo...," So this will be a little bit long, but hey, it is also a little important to have some background.

My  husband and I have been vegan for nearly 10 years, and life has moved  us from Canada, to the US, to Mexico. Through that journey, the only  time veganism has been hard - was in Mexico. I like weight training, and  the available options for proteins that were vegan, were heavily  processed soy, and really limited places to buy tofu. Essentially, it  started to get really hard. I was vegan for health first, then animal  compassion, and finally environmental reasons. However I have been  arguing in my head for the last few months, as my husband and my weight  ballooned. I pondered the idea of putting myself first, and having that  moral battle, and the desire to be healthy won out. I will be in Mexico  for at least until 2021, and I know my health cannot handle more of this  crap. Therefor - this weekend - we made the decision to switch to a  more whole food based diet that can be sustained here in Mexico and  maintain healthy proteins. (Side note, I am genetically disposed to  gout, and high volumes of soy flare it. As a vegan I had only 1 flare  up, and that was when I tried vegan keto - took waaaaay to much  supplementing to get my protein macros right).

Anyways, some stats:

Me: 38/m 323lbs and 5'10"" - Been weight training for \~2 years, focus more on heavy mass movement, than cardio.

Husband: 29/m 202lbs and 5'6"" - Mostly sedentary, trained with me in the early part, but lost interest. Mostly housework.

TODAY:  I stopped going to the gym, and instead shifted to my set of KBs at  home (18lb to 70lb) We started a routine, Prometheus kettlebell routine  w/Spin Bike for 10 mins. We will be doing this 3 times a week with the  off days being spin bike. I left the gym, so I could create a way for us  to work out together, and I think this will give us more time together  as well, which is nice. I also setup Cronometer again to start logging  and keeping track of food, so I can relearn what proteins offer what  micros and macros.

Anyways, on to the questions/ramblings...

I  realize that the Paleo lifestyle is not about meat, it is about whole  foods, therefor I am excited by the prospect of giant plates of brocolli  and greens, berries... mmm. Greens are hard to find here in mexico (in  good quality - organic is almost a no go). I do have questions on the  meat side...

Anyone else here ever  go vegan and convert, how did you cope? Mentally, and physiologically.  Not eating meat for 10+ years can certainly shock the body when you add  it back, cant it? Anything I should watch for?

It  has been over 10 years since I bought meat. I tried to buy some beef  and pork at Walmart down here yesterday, and I honestly got sweaty and  nervous and wasnt even sure what to buy, how much I need, and for  someone who does logistics for a living, I hit a mental block. How much  meat do you believe the two of us need in a week, and what cuts do you  recommend? I did buy frozen chicken breasts, so there is that...

Eggs - I have never liked them, are there any recipes you recommend to make them an easier part of breakfast?

Macros  - I have calculated out \~ 75-150g of protein per day as my need,  similar in carbs, and the rest as fat. Does this line up with what other  shave done? (2000 calorie diet), with working out, I actually burn  2800-3400/day. My husband is closer to \~ 2400/day max burn. Any guidance  here would be appreciated. I want to continue to build muscle and  maintain strength, as much as possible.

Goal  weight... somewhere close to 200 for me, and 160 for my husband, but  the real goal is when the body slows down and is healthy - we are there.  Any tips for planning for the maintenance stage of paleo? If we are  back in the USA, and I wish to return to veganism, are there any guides  you can recommend to maintain that?

I  cannot get out of my head on some of this stuff, and this post is  hopefully to seek some advice, it is one thing to start a new dietary  plan to fix your health, it is another to do it while shifting from  being a pure devout vegan. It is in my head, and I am feeling like a bad  person.",1573485952

Paleo,[Question] Do you think I can adopt a paleo diet?,"Hey all, I followed a paleo diet for quite some time before I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. Since then I’ve had my colon taken out and cannot digest nuts, vegetables,or fruits aside from puréed items (and applesauce, etc.) or mashed potatoes. I have an ileostomy so I can technically eat the products, however they do not digest and give me no caloric or nutritional value.

Paleo,[Discussion] what benefits have you personally experienced from going paleo? I'd love to share our experiences!,"Hey guys, I love seeing posts on here that talk of the positive health, wellbeing, and other benefits of going paleo.

I do mostly paleo low carb with 1 weekly cheat meal and occasional dairy (eg cheese in small amounts) and I've noticed the following

- Medically diagnosed IBS symptoms have completely disappeared.
- Medically diagnosed GORD (reflex) symptoms completely gone
- I have been able to completely stop taking 3 medications I used to take daily for the above 2 conditions, and no longer carry any emergency medications for flare ups either (I don't get flare ups anymore).
- My sinus problems (frequent infections, general stuffiness and runny noses) have stopped. They used to be so bad I got surgery (which improved it but I still had several sinus infections and flare ups requiring antibiotics and allergy tablets multiple times- this hasn't happened in MONTHS now)
- No more energy crashes. Sometimes my blood sugar got so low it was hypoglycaemic- I'd get dizzy, nauseous, and felt faint and out of it until I got food. This never happens anymore, even if my meals run late.i eat 3 meals a day, no snacks.
- much less adult acne, my skin has really cleared up noticeably.

And my favourite benefit out of the lot:

- easy weight loss. It just melts off. I've lost 13kg in a few months (with cheat meals and a holiday in that)

I am now CONVINCED that grains and dairy were not meant to be eaten by humans, certainly not in the modern overly- processed forms they are now. I now advocate that anyone struggling with digestive problems, inflammation of no known cause, and weight should take a serious look at their diet and try a diet of natural, whole foods- mostly vegetables and meat (unless medically advised otherwise)",1573285515

1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

58 g sour cream + 2 tsp apple cider vinegar

METRIC - US Cups

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE  KETO BREAD

Line a 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pan with parchment paper (an absolute must!). Set aside. 

Add yeast and maple syrup (to feed the yeast, see notes) to a large bowl. Heat up water to 105-110°F, and if you don't have a thermometer it should only feel lightly warm to touch. Pour water over yeast mixture, cover bowl with a kitchen towel and allow to rest for 7 minutes. The mixture should be bubbly, if it isn't start again (too cold water won't activate the yeast and too hot will kill it). 

Mix your flours while the yeast is proofing. Add almond flour, flaxseed meal, whey protein powder, psyllium husk, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, cream of tartar and ginger to a medium bowl and whisk until thoroughly mixed. Set aside. 

Once your yeast is proofed, add in the egg, egg whites, lightly cooled melted butter (you don't want to scramble the eggs or kill the yeast!) and vinegar. Mix with an electric mixer for a couple minutes until light and frothy. Add the flour mixture in two batches, alternating with the sour cream, and mixing until thoroughly incorporated. You want to mix thoroughly and quickly to activate the xanthan gum, though the dough will become thick as the flours absorb the moisture. 

Transfer bread dough to prepared loaf pan, using a wet spatula to even out the top. Cover with a kitchen towel and place in a warm draft-free space for 50-60 minutes until the dough has risen just past the top of the loaf pan. How long it takes depends on your altitude, temperature and humidity- so keep an eye out for it every 15 minutes or so. And keep in mind that if you use a larger loaf pan it won't rise past the top. 

Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C while the dough is proofing. And if you're baking at high altitude, you'll want to bake it at 375°F/190°C. 

Place the loaf pan over a baking tray and transfer gently into the oven. Bake for 45-55 minutes until deep golden, covering with a lose foil dome at minute 10-15 (just as it begins to brown). Just be sure that the foil isn't resting directly on the bread. 

Allow the bread to rest in the loaf pan for 5 minutes and transfer it to a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely for best texture- this is an absolute must, as your keto loaf will continue to cook while cooling! Also keep in mind that some slight deflating is normal, don't sweat it!

Keep stored in an airtight container (or tightly wrapped in cling film) at room temperature for 4-5 days, giving it a light toast before serving. Though you'll find that this keto bread is surprisingly good even without toasting!  


RECIPE NOTES

*You can feed the yeast with either inulin or an actual sugar (thanks for the inulin tip guys!). And do remember that the yeast will feed on such sugar to emit carbon dioxide, so it doesn’t affect the carb count. And yes, this is a scientific fact.
**If paleo (or in keto maintenance), feel free to sub 1/4 to 1/2 cup of almond flour with arrowroot flour for a lighter crumb. 
Please note that nutrition facts were estimated per slice, and we found the recipe to yield 12 generous slices. Though you could easily get 16-18 thinner slices.

Paleo,"I apologize if this is the wrong place for this question, but after reading ""The Hungry Brain"" by Stephan Guyenet, I have a question about the satiety and hyperpalitability of diet soda and Mio.","I know that a diet containing these wouldnt be considered truly Paleo, but is there any evidence that these drinks would effect one's overall satiety levels if they were the only sweet product consumed? 

I ask because I am much, much better at staying hydrated when I'm sleep deprived with Mio, and I can add some potassium and sodium to it if I can see that I've been lacking it in my diet for a few days in a row (On the road with limited food choices) 

But, I'm sure that consuming them is giving me a heightened level of dopamine, which may be hardwiring me to eat larger quantities of paleo food than I otherwise would have.",1572781256

Other weirdness: I sorted of fainted after the gym yesterday, and today my quads are quite sore (which never usually happens to me after the gym). It turns out the fainting was from dehydration. 

I’m just a little worried about what’s going on and whether I’m crazy to follow a regimen that’s going to be low in all the nutrients I previously got from bread, cereal, and Power Bars.

Paleo,[Blogspam] Hagrid's Paleo Rock Cakes,"***“Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid’s cooking, and took one at once.”*** **– Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince**

Throughout the Harry Potter books, Hagrid’s cooking is something that seems best to be avoided. As described in The Sorcerer’s Stone, “The rock cakes almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them.”

On the contrary, a classic Rock Cake has a consistency somewhat similar to a scone with a crumbly, rock-like outer and a soft, dense center. You’re going to be craving fall days curled up with a cuppa, a good book (preferably Harry Potter), and these Paleo Rock Cakes. They are chock full of aromatic spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves and I am a firm believer that the orange zest is what completely elevates them. It’s safe to say that your kitchen is going to smell delightful.

I have been depressed and low-energy my entire life. I am very athletic and exercise daily. My diet is high protein, high carb, high fiber, and VERY low fat. I eat meat and dairy, but I also love Go Lean cereal (soy). My weight is normal. 

I'm thinking of trying Paleo, but I'm afraid to start eating so much more dietary fat.  I'm also worried about eliminating dairy from my diet -- would it be possible to reap the mood benefits of Paleo while continuing to eat dairy?  Are GRAINS the main problem?

Paleo,[blog spam] Chicken Thighs in Orange Dijon Herb Sauce,"Chicken Thighs in Orange Dijon Herb Sauce is one of those marvelous dishes that looks and tastes like it took way more effort than it actually did.

Boneless chicken thighs are quickly seared in a cast iron pan before nestling into a bed of carrots, pearl onions, and creamy Orange Dijon Herb Sauce, then roasted in the oven until tender and lovely. The Orange Dijon Herb Sauce combines the sweet citrus notes of orange zest and juice, sharp Dijon mustard, and the classic French herbs tarragon and thyme. When added to a reduction of dry white wine and pearl onions, this sauce becomes magically creamy, without the need for cream or dairy of any kind.

This dish is date-night-worthy-delicious and comes together in under an hour.

However I do eat low fat items, etc. In a sense I at with olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits and very little processed foods. I have hypothyroidism so, I think trying paleo fully might be a good thing for me. I see however that fats are a big part of paleo. I have very severe acid reflux confirmed on a barium swallow. I wonder if this will be conflicting and if I will really be able to do paleo to the ""t"" since I am not supposed to eat anything fatty. I honestly do not eat fried foods or oily foods, I can't tolerate bacon or even coffee any longer. They make me have regurgitation terribly. I have not noticed problems when I eat something that I cooked using olive oil on our cast iron or stainless pans..

So, does anyone have very severe acid reflux who has done full paleo? Does it worsen it or get better? Perhaps remain constant?

Paleo,[Discussion] Anyone else struggle with anxiety when going out to eat?,"I get so much anxiety about going to restaurants where I have to ask questions about the food, especially if it’s a new one. Which is too bad because I used to love trying new places. Even the restaurants where I already know the menu and what modifications I need to make, I still worry about annoying everyone when I make those modifications. I’ve worked in multiple restaurants as a server, while I was rarely irritated with modifications, I knew some servers and kitchen staff that loathed them. Lately half the time I’m out to eat and have some questions a manager returns to the table in a panic and I need to ensure everyone it’s a preference, not an allergy, so no need for all the stress. I end up feeling bad, aware that if your modifications are not allergen based you risk irritating restaurant staff even more, but I do not want to lie about being allergic. I know I shouldn’t let this discourage me but I still get anxious about the whole process. Especially with the recent panic that I can tell is from restaurants taking allergies more seriously, which is great, but is increasing my guilt for being “difficult.” 

Anyone else struggle with this? Any tips or fun stories? 

The thing I’m the most hesitant to ask about or modify are the types of oils being used. But I do hate knowing there is Canola or Vegetable oil in my food. Does anyone attempt modifying oil much? I’m not eating out often so that’s part of why I let it slide at restaurants and avoid any sauces or dressings with an oil I wouldn’t use at home.

Paleo,[Question] From Keto to Paleo," 

Hi all,

Recently I had an experience with my Girlfriend’s family whom are Vietnamese which has made me want to switch from keto to Paleo. I hadn’t been on keto long, but I tried it to help with degenerative disc disease and chronic pain from an FAI.

I always thought my pain may be related to inflammation.. But after talking to my rheumatologist and him assuring me I didn’t show any physical signs of inflammation, my body was probably not within a highly inflamed State (this was before my keto attempt), but i tried anyway.

My experience with keto was actually good but I realized how restrictive it was when it came to trying new foods, especially with my girlfriends culture. With keto requiring a car for with keto requiring low-carb for you to stay in ketosis I figured Paleo might be a better option. This for me is more of a psychological thing, since I can remain eating mostly unprocessed foods while still allowing myself a Vietnamese meal once or twice, a doughnut, etc.

My questions: Being into heavy lifting, and then not following keto, I would like to still eat a decent amount of carbs. With that said besides fruit and yams I’m having a hard time finding carb sources, Who some of you eat other whole food carb sources such as potatoes, or what other foods are good carb sources especially following the work out?

Do people on Paleo often have more cheat days or more flexible diet days and people on keto? I assume this would be true since the main goal would not necessarily be the paddock state do people on Paleo often have more cheat days or more flexible diet days and people on keto?

I've tried keto before, I would continue it but it seems daunting since it's meal prep seems to requires more carb restriction. 

I want to start meal prepping, which should be really easy for me since I eat once a day. 

Primary goal is weight loss, I've dropped 20 over the past few months just following a loose pseudo-diet (by that what I really mean is not eating as much sugar in general and trying to cut back on how much I eat overall, which also got easier when I started eating once daily) 

Broke down on keto because I love bread and rice too much (I'm aware it's similar here with paleo though) 

Also I've always been turned off by paleo since it always seemed gimmicky and all in the marketing of ""eat like humans used to"" schpeal. Definitely don't care at all if anything I eat is organic.

The reason why I am doing this, is because I have not found an app or website that fits all of my needs. I want to create something that would be able to fit not only my needs, but also the needs of many others. Part of what I want to incorporate is the ability of someone adhering to a specific diet to be able to have the meal plan built based on those guidelines using user inputed recipes and meals.

Once I get the site up and running, I will be starting off small with a few beta testers, then I will allow invitations to be sent out as the site/app gets to a more finished state.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to go through with this survey.

Paleo,[Question] High calorie breakfast ideas?,"I eat a lot of bacon, so a decent amount of my breakfast calories comes from that. I don't want to eat bacon every day so I'm looking for ways to substitute those calories with something else. I could do more eggs but I already eat 4-5.

I try to keep my breakfasts' at least 600 calories. So 4 eggs is around 280, I also eat a banana and half and avocado so that's probably another 200-250. So I guess I really only need another 200 calories or so, any suggestions?

Some people will recommend nuts, but I prefer not to eat nuts during breakfast",1568160039

Paleo,[Question] about Paleo AIP,"Hello everyone first I want to share some stuff about me. I am a male, 23, 350lbs, and 6,3. I lost about 60lbs in the last two months, and I have Hidradenitis stage 1 for the previous 7-8 years. I started going to the Gym recently to lose weight, and it seems to be going fine for now.

Now I have a question about the AIP Paleo diet. Since I have prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD and Venlafaxine for OCD, does this affect the healing of my leaky gut? I've only had these two meds for the last three months, and the Issue was here for more than seven years. Can I still do the AIP Paleo diet to fix my leaky gut or will the meds not even allow the healing.

My second question since my meds suppress my hunger and I'm currently mostly just drinking protein shakes and eating some brown rice with it (i know it's not paleo didn't start yet), is there something like AIP Paleo protein Shakes, maybe some special vitamin pills if needed and which probiotics would u guys suggest.

If u guys have any suggestions and maybe can show me a good program/book program I would really appreciate it.

Paleo,ADHD and Paleo [other],"This is really great for me because I have been on and off amphetamines most of my life (started when I was 7), I'm now 22 I had varying side effects from the several medications. Not eating, then binge eating on days I'd skip, headaches after crashing, insomnia, paranoia, weight loss, crankiness, anxiety, depression, mood swings.

I stopped for a few years after I turned 18 and suffered for it a bit but I couldn't go back on it. After I quit I gained weight, lost my job, had very little drive. Things were bad for awhile but how could I pay for success with my health, which was declining on my meds?

Being turning to a mostly Paleo diet (and also when I tried keto for a bit, but certain parts about it weren't doing well with my body so I stopped!) has made it so I can focus without mind numbing medications that make me feel like a robot. I wasn't really here to lose weight, as I've always been very small girl, even after the aforementioned weight gain, but I feel way better. Not really sure how Paleo has fixed me, this isn't one of the effects I was expecting! Thanks Paleo! :D",1567802357

Paleo,Improving texture of homemade paleo gummy bears?,"So, I have made homemade paleo gummy bears a few times, using fruit juice, plain gelatin, and honey. They usually turn out with a texture that is more like a firmer jello, without the same chew/resistance of a proper store-bought gummy bear.

I’ve always kind of assumed it had something to do with the lack of corn syrup, but Smart Sweets manages to pull it off in theirs. I just have a hard time justifying paying $4 for a 50g pack and would love to figure out how to make gummies at home with a proper, slightly chewy texture.

The Smart Sweets bears have a few extra ingredients but the ones that stuck out to me were the tapioca starch and inulin fibre. Maybe if I added some tapioca starch it would help?

Paleo,"[Discussion] Motivate me, point me in the right direction","I'm not sure who all this has happened to before. But I just cannot get traction and good habits going with Paleo. 

History: 2010-2011 did Paleo at about 70% level. Lost approx 40 lbs from 285 to 245. In this time period everything improved my mental health was the biggest win...anxiety issues, lightheaded feelings, mood swings. All that was nearly improved 100%. Also just my drive for getting stuff done and life was better. 

Then I fell off the bandwagon slowly...and for goodness sake I cannot get back on. 

I'm back to square one 285 lbs again, mood swings. Anxiety/stress intolerance issues. Stress and tension all over. Gut doesn't love me...My 2x shirts are starting to get tight around my belly at 5'11"" 285. I'm generally unenthusiastic and worried alot. Generally because I am either dealing with headaches, allergy issues, or pain in general. 

This morning I took a walk and it was the icing on the cake. I literally got passed by a jogger, a jogger who could be my great grandmother she was without a doubt in her 70's. Granted I was walking but still. Also my allergies, tension etc is causing me to have what seems like vertigo issues on occasion as well. 

 And yet! Even with all that said and the huge frustration that I face dealing with it. My brain and I just cannot get back on track nutrition wise. I'm either eating to much hard candy during the day( when I get my anxiety feelings, I always reach for something quick carb like) which sometimes I think its not anxiety and its a metabolic problem due to my habits.   
I sit most of the day working on my computer.....

I'm looking for any suggestions. What have you done to either keep yourself on the wagon or get back on and stay on.",1567186001

Paleo,Food similar to lamb shanks,"I seem to have had difficulties with a lot of foods due to histamine/autoimmune/amine/ gut issues. This includes beef bone broth, dairy, nuts, eggs, chicken skin and a bunch of other stuff. I've found eating in a paelo direction helps, especially lamb shanks. 

Other parts of Lamb are good, but not as good as Lamb shank, cut in half and put in a pressure cooker for 2 hours. I'm guessing that it's to do with the bone/connective tissues in it.

 So I was wondering if there was any other meat like it so that I can diversify the meat in my diet. I'm very nervous about trying chicken, outside of fresh chicken breast I don't seem to have a good reaction to it: I get flashes in my eyes from eggs, intense constaption from chicken soup, headaches from poor quality breast. Beef is a maybe, but I'm not sure what sort of cuts would be worth asking for. When it's spring I'll try out veal shins. I'm not sure of my reaction to pork.

Paleo,"Why the research on red meat being bad for your health should be thrown out, as explained by Nina Teicholz","We’ve all been told that eating fat will make us fat. But what is that advice based on? We aren’t told if we eat fish we’ll grow gills, we don’t think that if we eat grains our bodies will develop pellet-like deposits. That’s because we have some understanding of digestion. The body takes in food, breaks it all down and then distributes the nutrients based on what it needs and what it can discard. So why have we taken such a simple visual idea that eating fat makes us fat and adopted it whole cloth?

Many say we shouldn’t have accepted this idea and the fact that we did is directly related to why so many of us are tired, sick and fat. 

For 20 years, The New York Times best-selling author and investigative reporter Nina Teicholz was a vegetarian. Despite eating what she thought was a healthy diet, along with a daily run or bike ride, Teicholz struggled to lose weight, had fertility challenges and generally didn’t feel great. When she reintroduced meats into her life, things seemed to improve. This led her down the rabbit hole of why meats and dietary fats were taboo. The end result of her quest to understand how she’d been so misled is The New York Times bestseller ""The Big Fat Surprise.""

We produce a show called Empowered Health, a podcast focused on navigating women's health, we just released an episode featuring Teicholz about how dietary fats have been so vilified by both the research and media communities. Figured this subreddit may be interested in the episode.

Teicholz's work has disrupted orthodox nutrition beliefs, challenged the dietary guidelines, and debunked the weak science around dietary fat. Yet, the conventional research community still has trouble wrapping their heads around it.The mainstream media doesn’t seem to have an awareness of what good vs. faulty nutrition research looks like, nor do they have time to dig into the funding sources of large studies. The media is just as confused as most Americans about what’s good or bad research. Most daily reporters do not have time to dive deep into these important topics and instead just report on whatever the recent press release from reputable institutions says. This is terrible reporting and has a dangerous impact on all of us. We think it also makes the medial culpable for our current obesity and chronic illness environment, something Teicholz and our host are more than aware of and explain in depth this week.

Paleo,[Question] Is anyone making low carb ice cream?,"Honestly not sure where to post this. I've searched communities and YouTube for recipes and haven't found a thing. 

I went autoimmune protocol, and now I'm sort of on a keto/Paleo diet. I can't make ice cream with dairy and I'm not sure about egg for a custard, the last time I had eggs I felt funny. 

On AIP I ate Paleo carbs, but I didn't like the way I felt after them. I'm especially not happy with the way I digested honey (constant farts).

I have incorporated artificial sweeteners and stevia and have been totally fine with that. A few days ago I took thickened coconut milk (almost as thick as coconut cream) and blended it with strawberries and artificial sweeteners, then put it in an ice cream maker. Of course when it was done it was like a gorgeous soft serve.....and then turned into a hunk of ice in the freezer. (Btw great popsicle recipe though)

Paleo,[Question] on eggs and leaky gut,"What's the deal with eggs? Cordain and others have pretty much condemned them as a frequent food.

I know so many people eat eggs every day, but so many people also eat potato chips and drink coke. Is it possible eggs are doing us harm, even if it is only slight?

&amp;#x200B;

[https://thepaleodiet.com/lysozyme-clarification/](https://thepaleodiet.com/lysozyme-clarification/)  


  
*""Without question our pre-agricultural ancestors would have collected and consumed eggs from birds’ nests whenever possible. However, in the wild, bird eggs only appear seasonally. Hence, pre-agricultural humans could have never consumed two eggs for breakfast every morning of the year similar to some westernized people, but rather only occasionally for a few brief weeks or months...*  


  
*Lysozyme is an unusual protein because it rapidly breeches the gut barrier and enters human circulation...* 

  
*Absorption of pure egg white lysozyme by itself into circulation is likely not problematic because lysozyme is an enzyme that the body naturally produces. Rather it is the complexes that lysozyme forms with other egg white proteins, gut borne bacterial peptides and food peptides that may adversely stimulate the immune system. When these chimeric (monster) molecules breech the gut barrier via their net positive charge and enter circulation, they have the capacity to promote allergy and autoimmune disease.""*",1565702879

Paleo,NYT Story: Former Vegetarian Butchers/Meat-Eaters [Article],"Thought I would share this - about former vegetarians/vegans who started eating meat and became butchers/entrepreneurs who only source their meat from grass-fed, open pasture farms:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/dining/butchers-meat-vegetarian-vegan.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/dining/butchers-meat-vegetarian-vegan.html)

What surprised me was this discussion of the benefits of eating meat:

\_\_\_

“As soon as I started eating meat, my health improved,” she said. “My mental acuity stepped up, I lost weight, my acne cleared up, my hair got better. I felt like a fog lifted.” All of the meat was from healthy, grass-fed animals reared on the farms where she worked.

Other former vegetarians reported that they, too, felt better after introducing grass-fed meat into their diets: Ms. Kavanaugh said eating meat again helped with her depression. Mr. Applestone said he felt far more energetic.

“It can be hard to balance your diet as a vegetarian, especially when you’re younger, and I wasn’t doing it right,” he said.

Grass-fed and -finished meat has been shown to be more healthful to humans than that from animals fed on soy and corn, containing higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid, beta carotene and other nutrients. Cows that are fed predominantly grass and forage also have better health themselves, requiring less use of antibiotics.

\_\_

Now I’m curious about any studies behind the increase of those nutrients mentioned in that last paragraph.",1565294181

Paleo,[blogspam] Polyjuice Potion Smoothie,"According to [J.K. Rowling](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/polyjuice-potion), “*The Polyjuice Potion, which is a complex and time-consuming concoction, is best left to highly skilled witches and wizards. It enables the consumer to assume the physical appearance of another person, as long as they have first procured part of that individual’s body to add to the brew (this may be anything — toenail clippings, dandruff or worse — but it is most usual to use hair)*.”

In the books, Polyjuice Potion is used many times. First by Harry, Ron, and Hermione to gain information about the Chamber of Secrets, then by Barty Crouch Jr. to pose as Mad-Eye Moody in The Goblet of Fire, and finally by several of Harry’s close friends in order to transport him from Privet Drive safely in the Deathly Hallows.

While this Polyjuice Potion Smoothie may not turn you into a totally different person, it’s likely to set you out on the right foot for the day, i.e. with a full belly and a bit of healthy energy to keep you fueled through your morning. Unlike the Polyjuice Potion in the books, which takes roughly a month to make, my version takes 5 minutes or less to create an requires no hair or toenail clippings. In fact, I strongly discourage adding those things.

# Project New Brain

**What is Project New Brain?**

A free neuroscience project aimed at helping you form permanent health-related brain patterns(habit) that last. We accept participants on **weekly social contracts** at **no cost** while providing personal checkups, rewards, and donations based on their performance. This is a **research in** **progress** and we need your help to perfect it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why call it a brain pattern and not a habit?**

A habit is a combination of many patterns formed in the brain. Multiple synapses must form solidly for habits to last. Thus, we go beyond a “Just do it” approach

&amp;#x200B;

**How is this different from other habit-forming methodologies?**

We bring expertise from neuroscience and behavioural psychology to develop the most efficient and effective protocols for neurological pattern forming. We use the following formulas(hypothesis):

1. Good cause: we make donations every time you reach a certain level of pattern forming.
2. Social Contract(free): You engage in a social contract of sharing your commitment.
3. Visualization: write it down and see your progress and results.
4. Personal checkups (through emails, messages): we check your progress for accountability.
5. Reward points(neurons): healthy dopamine rush that leads to our donations.

**We start the next trial round on July 29th and now accepting limited participants.** Every round, we’ll increase the participant count.

**For more information** about the process, reward, and this research as a whole, please visit our subreddit and check \[Meta\] and \[Accepting\] tagged post.

Paleo,[question] Energy Ball Recipe Tweak,"Hi, so I attempted to make an energy ball thingy, that I have never done before and like glanced at other recipes. So I used:

\- then I dusted just the tops with a cinnamon/ground cardamom mixture

\- then topped it with some leftover crushed almonds and then sit in the fridge to cool

My question is, is there something I can combine with the almond butter that will allow the coating to harden vs just be cold?

Like chocolate when it cools will usually harden, I am wondering if there is a nut butter or a combination of ingredients that can acts as harder shell coating when cooled. Thanks in advance.",1564281067

Paleo,DON'T LISTEN TO THE LIES THAT THEY TELL YOU ! [Discussion],"Time and time again I will see the same posts asking questions such as ' can I eat nuts' 'can I eat seeds' 'are vegetables okay' 'our ancestors didn't eat mushrooms right?' 

And then I read answers like 'no our ancestors would NEVER eat vegetables ' or 'they only ate nuts but rarely fruit '

And it's just frustrating to read because... They didn't just eat nuts or seeds or meat or fish or fruits or vegetables...

THEY ATE EVERYTHING! 

Anybody that knows a single shred of human history from the past would know that our ancestors who lived among the giant jungles of this planet ate all of those things! The ENTIRE PLANET WAS ONE MASSIVE JUNGLE !  Hunter and gatherers travelled and migrated throughout the planet from country to country finding whatever food they could and eating whatever they could to survive. Different weather and different seasons means different animals and vegetation could be found in those seasons so it was mostly climate dependant..

So one size doesn't fit all because there is no size and there is no shoe..

Follow the guidelines and trust your heart and listen to your own bodily instincts because some random reddit guy can't tell you what the best thing for your body will be . they don't know who your ancestors were and neither do you but you can trust your gut and eat what feels right. Find out what you REALLY crave because the only person that knows what you need is YOU...

Paleo,[Question] for Carnivores,"I know that for many, Carnivore is therapeutic and medicinal. But I'm asking this to the people who believe this WOE is what we evolved to eat, that our ancestors ate this way.

I firmly believe that animal based diets are optimal and that we evolved eating huge quantities of animal foods. I also believe that we would never have intentionally restricted plant food. If there were berries or nuts available, we would have eaten them. They would not have been a major part of our diet, but they would have been included (is this incorrect?)

The logic of ancestral health is: if we did it for thousands of years, it is ""expected"" or necessary in some way, e.g. eating meat, fasting, sunlight, good sleep, exercise. So I always think, if we are trying to model our way of life on what our ancestors did, should we include some plant food from time to time? Is there something we might not know about that may be useful? I know there's nothing on paper, right now, that says they're necessary, but is the fact that they were included at all in the diet of our ancestors reason enough to eat small amounts? Might our bodies be expecting *some*plant food at *some* stage for *some* reason?",1563793278

Paleo,"happier and better when eating ""unhealthy""","Hi ! 

I'm not really paleo, but i pass by some periods of time in which i try to stick a paleo/healthy/primal diet.

Problem is, I feel happier, more satisfied and overall better when I'm eating unhealthy. Especially at this tough moment of my life. my taste is lowered so everything seems quite tasteless. eating something not-paleo, processed, sweet or salty, full of flavors is what adds a spark to my days.

To give an example:

at breakfast, i had fried eggs and black coffee. 

brunch: watermelon

Lunch: a paleo meal

afternoon: i'm full but not proper ""satisfied"". i can eat a lot of something that i don't really like, and i still feel like i had barely eaten anything.

had some vinegar crisps (my weakness, and can't reproduce the flavour on my own at home), and a chocolate bar (dark pure chocolate is good, but not as the rest)  
dinner: a cheese sandwich, and some noodles.

I could live eating only ""bad"" food, even if it's just a bit, i'd feel satisfied.

Any insight ? :)",1563643276

Paleo,Any advice on the paleo diet and lifting for muscle? (Whether the diet is right for gains) [Question],"I’ve been on/off lifting routines and diets for years and have been anywhere between 160-190 pounds on various nutrition plans (currently 178 with a tad more body fat then I want.) I love the sound of the paleo diet but I also have a few questions:

1. Do lifters find it hard to put on muscle while consuming less carbs on this diet?
2. How much is too much for carbs and protein on this diet?
3. Do any lifters get overly fatigued while lifting and doing this diet?
4. When consuming carbs, what would you pick as your sources (sweet potatoes, starchy vegetables, etc.)
5. How do you feel your overall strength is compared to times that you’ve had other diets and been lifting?

I’m still researching this diet so I have a lot of questions. Any advice, whether for lifting or for the diet itself, would be greatly appreciated. Also if you don’t have advise on lifting or the paleo diet but have a sweet dad joke, I’ll take that instead. Thanks in advance.",1563570369

I am doing intermittent fasting 16/8 and planning on doing a water fast day into my routine. 

As far as I know these encourage ketosis/autophagy benefits anyway. And as a slim guy I have no need or want for weight loss quite the opposite really

I know over time he had tried a number of different workouts, diets and who knows what else in order to feel better and drop some weight but had never succeeded. He said he had been ""dancing with"" the number 300lbs. for years and had finally hit it early this year. I think it was a wake up call for him. He had to do something. 

Like everything he does, he crunched the data, learning all he could about the science of paleo (way more deeply than I did) and made a plan. He and his wife follow a paleo diet now and both continue to lose weight, feel better, and are real converts now. 

But what really struck me about talking to him by the grill outside was something he said: 

He said, **""I feel like I finally got the homo sapien user manual after just guessing all these years.""** Yeah!  That's it. We've all tried to put together furniture or operate electronics without following the instructions and I for one always have a better experience and outcome when I RTFM.

Just wanted to pass along that Blue Apron is doing a Whole 30 promotion for September.  You can get 3 different meals a week (I’m doing two servings I don’t know if you can do 4 servings).  They actually did this back in Jan/Feb (was surprised I didn’t see anything on here about it).  I did it back then and although there were some misgivings I liked it enough to sign up again.  The meals are on the small side although I found them just filling enough (I’m kind of a pig though), they seemed to really like Harissa flavoring, and a lot were of the protein and sides variety which isn’t usually my jam (I make more stir frys and stews). We also had a box delayed due to a storm, and some of the produce was a tad off. In spite of that, My partner and I really liked some of the recipes and were overall glad we did it.  I unsubscribed when the promotion was over and haven’t had an issue except just getting emails from them. You can also skip weeks. Just thought I’d pass it along - maybe if others sign up we can post at the end with our thoughts about this go around.  Looking at the recipes it looks like they’ve mixed it up a bit.

I haven't followed Paleo in quite awhile mostly because the low carb aspect of it made my workouts feels like actual death and my recovery was awful. I switched to macro counting with Renaissance Periodization, and when I really commit to a cut cycle I do have success with it. Recently my doctor increased my Synthroid dose and I sincerely think that going back to cutting out gluten and dairy at the very least would help stabilize my levels again. 

I'd like to stick with RP and macro counting in general, but wanted to know if anyone has done that while also following Paleo. It gets tricky because I am allergic to nuts so my only source of fats comes from sunflower seeds and oil or butter that I may (very rarely) cook with. 

Any insight or tips/suggestions are greatly appreciated! :)",1562007587

Paleo,Tips for the late night munchies?,"Hey there, I’m pretty new to the paleo thing. I started the “lifestyle change” 3 weeks ago and I’ve been really good about it. My biggest issue, though, is getting hungry later at night. I know I SHOULDN’T be eating after 8 or so, but I find that’s one of the peak times I’m hungry (between 8 and 10 pm, and after I get up in the morning.) 

I think the hardest part for me is that many nights, eating at 5 or 6 is just not possible. I’m a college student and a waitress, so I’m in class during the day and I have to be at work anytime between 3 and 5 pm about 3 to 4 days a week. This means that when I’m off at 8, 9, or 10 pm I’m STARVING, but I feel super guilty eating that late. 

Any tips?",1561950926

It comes together in 5-minutes or less with totally clean ingredients and pairs well with so many things that you might want to keep a jar in the fridge at all times.

The fella follows a pretty low-carb Keto diet and as a result many of the sauces that he gravitates toward tend to be mayo or cream-based, which I sometimes get burnt out on. This Romesco Sauce is a perfect solution for us as it fits his low-carb diet, but swaps the mayo and cream for a rich blend of almonds + roasted peppers + tomatoes + citrus + herbs + spices.

Paleo,"[Question] While fully dairy-free mode, how do you guys and gals handle calcium intake?","I'm 2 days into this low-calorie 5-day fast mimicking diet that I like to do at the end of the month. Looking on cronometer, my calcium intake is basically nothing. for these days, aside from what you get from a salad with some avocado and a handful of mixed nuts. Over the month, I get calcium from sardines (although, I'm not eating these more than a few cans a week) and dark greens. But even while eating a ton of dark greens, it's hard to get more than 400-500mg some days.

This is easily remedied with a calcium-carbonate drink like almond milk. I've heard some paleo folk recommend these products for the calcium, while others recommend a lot more canned fish, and others yet just allow Ca to stay very low.

My take on the classic mayo + relish base also includes a healthy dose of fresh green herbs, lemon zest, capers, Dijon mustard, and even a splash of Worcestershire sauce for good measure (or coconut aminos for Paleo!). It’s safe to say that it will kick the notion of just opening a plain jar of processed tartar sauce right out of your mind.

This sauce comes together in 5 minutes or less and is fantastic on fried, baked, or grilled fish and other seafood – I particularly love to use it on this recipe for [Crispy Oven Fried Fish](https://whipandwander.com/crispy-oven-fried-fish/). This sauce is also a great dipping option for french fries (or their Keto counterparts) and drizzled on top of roasted vegetables.

Paleo,"Question, More out of Silly Fear than Lacking Knowledge [Question] ."," Hello everyone! I've been eating Paleo for about two months now, but I've been concerning myself with eating a ketogenic-style diet moreso as I never gave this a chance. I lost 100 pounds eating a carb based, practically zero fat diet and after educating myself by reading studies and absorbing knowledge from individuals like Chris Kresser's and Dr. Rhonda Patrick's (I'm a fan of The JRE) books and podcasts, I've adopted a diet completely free of any processed food. I have an Alpha-Galactose allergy, a very bad one at that. It took me a long time to get diagnosed and ate horrifically my entire life before i learned what food really was. This poor diet of pounds of processed meat and bacon and sugar and carbs made taking so long to figure out what this vector-borne tick allergy really was a blight on my health as my allergy worsened with every encounter with red meat, butter, cheese, lard, etc. My current diet is largely nuts, coconut oil, organ meats, and loads of fish. I would like to emphasize the nuts and fish. I eat salmon and sardines extremely regularly and I eat around 60g of almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, and pecans daily. I also eat 30g of Brazil nuts. I know nuts contain phytate, an antinutrient and I get plenty of dietary calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc, but I know this many nuts cannot be good for those nutrients. I eat ketogenically because I'm still irrationally terrified of fat. The basis of this post and my question is if I reintroduce vegetables to take my carbs from &lt;40g a day to \~15-20% of my diet, leaving protein at 30% and fat at 50-55%, will I become a fat waste of oxygen again? I'm mortally terrified of gaining weight again and this fear circumvents the vast knowledge I've accumulated since my allergy diagnosis. I know that I burn fat on keto and I haven't gained any weight eating this way, but unless I chug coconut oil and eat an entire salmon a day, I'm having a hard time meeting my fat goal as I require a lot of calories to maintain my muscle and weight since I exercise a great amount daily. I'm fearful to introduce carbs and have my body use the still relatively low amount of carbs I would theoretically be eating and store all my healthy fats. Thanks to anyone reading this and planning on responding in advance. I appreciate you so much. PS: My body has no issue going into ketosis with this much protein and has loved me since I cut out all the wheat fiber low fat nonsense I lost weight on. I'm a healthy (besides the alpha-gal and seasonal allergies) 20 year old kid who's body is very adaptive and malleable to the calories I give it.",1559993417

Paleo,[Question] Activated charcoal and bentonite clay.,"A little background:

I have been on a ketogenic/low carb diet for roughly 1,5 years by now. Tried carnivore for one month last November, and then again for a month this April. I just found it difficult to maintain by relying on ground beef for 90% of the time. Once I get my finances in a better shape and can afford quality cuts, then it might become easier. That said, between November and until now my diet has been 90% from the animal kingdom. Now, one of the main reasons I moved to keto universe, and from there to carnivore was a total lack of energy and low productivity. Also, I have a problem with (what I assume to be) psoriasis. While my energy levels and productivity has skyrocketed. It improved a lot on keto, but really skyrocketed with the carnivore diet, and I do maintain it even on a 90%+ meat based diet. Have lost quite a lot of body fat (though I was not fat by any means) as well, and gained some muscle (might also have to do with having the energy to exercise more). All that said, my psoriasis is still alive and well. Obviously I am not expecting to get rid of it overnight (or even after 1 month of carnivore), but I was wondering, that could my psoriasis originate from the tons of oxalates, lectins, and other poisons I consumed when on the standard diet, and even on the keto diet? If so, how could I hasten the removal of those nasty crystals and poisons? Could activated charcoal help bind them? Bentonite clay? Could having a sauna help with getting rid of them? Cold showers?",1559750792

Paleo,[Question] Fibre and Stool,"What is the paleo consensus on fibre? Specifically as it pertains to constipation and hard stool. I currently eat keto, and just tried zero carb/carnivore for 3 months. I didn't feel the latter to offer any improvements, but wasn't a negative experience other than to say it hasn't releived the constipation/hardstool I've experienced throughout eating keto/low carb. I've also tried discussing this on keto specific forums but the amount of unfriendly dogmatic people is a real strain to deal with. I'm asking here because I'm considering trying a much higher fibre intake.

If fibre isn't the cause of constipation/makes it worse then how have those that have experienced it (if any) relieved it?

The only advice i've gotten so far from keto/zc sources: eat more fat (not sure how, I don't like raw fat and, afaict, eat a fair amount as it is, so I'm unsure how to physically add more or how much), eat lots of Mg (i take 3x MgCit supplements a day, 300mg. I'd rather source from food if possible), drink more water (I drink to thirst).

My experience of low carb eating has been radical. In all other areas it has been positive. But this aspect is a real problem for me. It seems commensurate with a much lower fibre intake, but the consensus seems to be that fibre is bad. People cite that Fiber Menace guy and resort to all sorts of n=1 claims. None of which seem to be scientific, or backed up (pardon the pun) by evidence. So it's very difficult to sort truth from urban myth.

Does high protein cause this?

So I’m despairingly looking for a coach who can follows and helps me, and kick my ass when I loose motivation.

However, there are vegans and vegetarians that claim people can achieve the same results, even in bodybuilding, without eating any animal products.

Furthermore, people also say that by avoiding meat, you are maintaining good spiritual standing by reducing the incentive to sell meat.

I'll start by saying 2 months ago I didn't believe I suffered from any AI diseases or had any unique food allergies, I just knew that I would get very sleepy after meals, and found I was most productive if I fasted during the day as long as I could.  About 2 months ago my fiancè and I began the keto diet for a month to lose some weight for summer, the weight came off but the diet did not feel sustainable.  Ever since I stopped and reintroduced carbs I've been suffering from constant brain fog/fatigue/an inability to focus, and I'm starting to think it may be linked to sugar/wheat/gluten.

Is this normal this early in paleo?

Paleo,[question] Why am I not getting enough fiber on the Paleo diet?,"I have been 80/20 paleo for over a year now. I used to suffer from daily headaches, itchy skin and eyes, a nose that would run constantly, intense sneezing fits, and a high esoniphil count. With cooking paleo - those symptoms have descreased substansially - and even on the weekends when I cheat - they are not as intense. I found a balance that I can manage - I've toned up, have a flatter tummy, and have been feeling overall better - except for one thing... pooping.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine how the ideal human body can remove waste the way that I do. Soft, smelly, hard to get out / getting stuck, and wiping is a nightmare + cramps and the need to go more than once a day. No success using fiber supplements - On weekends (when i cheat) - things go much smoother.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is - why am I not getting the fiber i need from a paleo diet?

Here's what i ate last week:

Breakfast - an apple / bananna / raw almonds and black coffee

Steak, roasted sweet potatoe with skin

Buffalo Chicken Casserole - contains chicken breast, celery, bell peppers, eggs, buffalo sauce, various spices

&amp;#x200B;

My undestanding is vegetables should be a substanial source of fiber - maybe i'm missing something or i'm really not getting enough vegetables (hard to believe since I spend about an hour a week chopping them for my recipies).

Any ideas or similar issues out there? I can continue to eat ceral as my fiber source, but I do find myself getting headaches, and I would love to see where i'm missing out on paleo fiber.",1557166960

Paleo,[Question] Weight loss without calorie counting?,"Hey Team,

For those that have had success losing weight with the paleo diet (without calorie counting religiously) do you think that your calorie reduction came from..

* satiation from fat, ultimately eating less
* cals in paleo carbs are significantly less than cals from grains/SAD food
* body adjusts to cleaner diet and you don't feel as hungry so you eat less (i experienced this with whole 30)

I have steadily lost weight (and kept it off) with calorie counting, but i have a lot more to go and religious calorie counting is incredibly challenging. Great things in life are challenging, but this is like an interruption to my life.

I can pick up ingredients at the grocery store tomorrow but I’ve already got red onions, cilantro, Roma tomatoes, and white sweet potatoes, which I can use if need be.",1556594147

Paleo,[BlogSpam] Paleo Crockpot Tagine,"Slow Cooker Chicken Tagine sounds like a rare dish. Although the name might sound unfamiliar to most, the flavor will be shocking. This flavorful dish is slowly cooked to the point where flavors develop nicely. This slow cooker chicken tagine is a great way to prepare chicken in a different way.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you are here, have you tried this simple [oven roasted broccoli recipe](https://realricofitness.com/4-ingredients-roasted-broccoli/)?

Tagine is the name of a dish that is popular in Morocco. The ingredients vary from family to family but generally consist of a few basic ingredients. These generally include ginger, dried fruit, cumin, and cinnamon among others. Tagine is named after the clay pot that it is cooked in, a tagine. It works similar to a slow cooker, a cooler looking one for sure!

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things I enjoy about this slow cooker tagine is that it is made with a variety of its ingredients. All of which are pretty easy to find. The spices I used include cinnamon and cumin. While the base is onions and carrots. Nothing too strange or expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Don’t panic about the cinnamon, we only use enough for the flavor profile. Also, for the health benefits. On this slow cooker chicken tagine, the cinnamon will provide a dose of power antioxidants. This spice has anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory properties.

&amp;#x200B;

The macros for the Slow Cooker Chicken Tagine are the following:

* Calories: 200
* Fats: 8
* Carbs: 8
* Protein: 24

With a few calories and a ton of protein, this Slow Cooker Chicken Tagine is loaded. The sweet, spicy, and savory of this dish will make you love it. I recommend enjoying it with a side of tahini sauce or your choice of vegetables.

I hope that you enjoy!

Paleo,[Question] Anyone know how to make authentic tasting Chinese steamed Chicken and Veggies?,"Seems like steamed chicken and veggies is pretty similar from most Chinese restaurants. And it's fairly paleo and tastes great. But for some reason I can't find a good recipe for it online and every attempt I've made has failed. The chicken comes out weird steaming it or the veggies are too soggy. I've been using the Instapot with the steam setting with the top on and set to vent but not sure if that's right.

I'm also told that the sauce is just the drippings from the chicken with corn starch and salt to thicken it.

Seems like it's just thin sliced chicken, broccoli, julienned carrots (sometimes celery), snap peas, muschrooms, baby corn (will skip), water chestnuts.

Paleo,[blogspam] Deviled Eggs with Smoked Chorizo,"Though there are endless ways to make a deviled egg, my absolute favorite is to top them with a thick slice of paleo chorizo that’s been seared slightly before it’s sliced. Topping them with chorizo also negates the need to do any fancy piping, which makes them even more simple to whip together.

These Deviled Eggs with Smoked Chorizo are not only an awesome Keto and Paleo appetizer, but they’re incredibly easy to throw together in less than an hour for easy meal prep during the week. I pack them for an easy, work-friendly breakfast, to supplement salads at lunch, and both the fella and I regularly poke into the fridge for one or two when we’re feeling peckish after work.

Paleo,An Electrolyte Story[Discussion],"I am 100% carnivorous.  Most meal's main course is 1 lbs. of grass fed ground beef and one zerocarb smoothie of kefir, heavy whipping cream, 1/2 of a chicken liver, sweeten with stevia and honey.  I am 73.5 years old.  
The following five items (and perhaps more) started happening when I started experimenting and supplementing with an electrolyte combination of water, sodium chloride (sea salt), dicalcium phosphate, magnesium bicarbonate, magnesium sulphate, potassium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate.  
1.  After only 2 hours of sleep, I drove 90 miles to pick up my son at the airport and then drove 90 miles back.  NO. PROBLEMS. WHAT. SO. EVER.  No migraines, no irritability, no blind patches in my field of vision (my very least favorite).  No death crashes on the freeway.  There is no f\*\*\*in' way that I could have done that before I started with the electrolytes on April 5th.       
2.  Now the pain from my collapsed disk is microscopic to zero.  Before April 5th, I'd say that it was slightly bothersome.  From 5 years ago up to about 1 year ago it was anywhere from hell to very bothersome.  
3.  The blood in my saliva completely disappeared since I started electrolyte supplementation.  This is a major improvement.  I brush with sodium bicarbonate powder caked on top of conventional tooth paste, and I give every section of what is left of my teeth 10 strokes at least with a hard brush, so before the electrolyte experiment I was getting really bad RED in my post brushing spit.  Yes, niacin supposedly will take care of that, but I want what I actually need to eat on a regular basis to fix problems, not a thumb-in-the-dyke approach.  Popping pills is to remember and cost money.  They can also leave out a lot of problems that real nutritional improvements will heal.  
4.  Itchiness while meditating and/or going to sleep reduced greatly.  This is a seemly insignificant improvement that portends of big health benefits.        
5.  There seems to be one downside, which I am certain will improve over time: insomnia.  
This is such a huge mega development for me that I have to rethink everything that is extant about electrolytes and minerals, especially for older people.  
1. No commercial product that I have seen is worth a shit.  One was pretty good but it costs too much.   One commercial product had only table salt added so it could be called ""electrolyte.  WTF!!!!  
2. Since you are going to be doing this for the rest of your life (thanks to weakened agricultural soils), you want it as inexpensive as possible.  I do it myself for myself for perhaps less than $100 PER YEAR per person, or $.27 per day. Bulksupplements.com helps a lot to keep the price down.  
3.  You don't need a medical doctor to diagnosis an electrolyte imbalance.  You almost certainly have one, especially if you are old and/or if you workout really vigorously for long periods of time.  I figure that most of my health problems have been because of electrolyte deficiency, even going back 55 years.  Yes, 55 years of struggling to be healthy because farmers insist upon artificial soils: sort of a war between our collective intuition that says that artificial isn't healthy and capitalistic pressure/competition.  
4.  You cannot believe how much stronger I feel.  Even my knees feel strong.  I didn't say ""stronger"" because I have never felt weak knees because they were always weak compared with now.  Emotionally I feel stronger.  I bounce around the house now like a teenager on coffee.   😁😂   
There is so much more to say.  This is not just a topic.  It is a revolution and a solution for oh so many problems.",1555724271

* 06.20: Smoothie with spinach, 1 apple, and handful of blueberries.

* 11.30: Smoothie with kale, mango, spinach, coconot water, lime. A handful of nuts (mix of almond, cashew, macadamia).

* 16.00: Dinner with meat for the 'fresh meat counter' at the supermarket. Usually 3 bacon burgers, 3 fish burgers, or chicken fillet. No bread for the 'burgers' of course. Fried onion on the side.

* 20.30: 4 scrambled eggs, or a packet of bacon. Sometimes also a handful of nuts (mix of almond, cashew, macadamia).

* 4 cups of black coffee each day.

* Supplements: Multivitamins, and D-vitamins, each day.",1555584981

Paleo,[Blogspam]TEN STEPS FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO THE PALEO DIET FOR KIDS:," 

**TEN STEPS FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO THE PALEO DIET FOR KIDS** 

**1.Make one simple change at a time.** 

Be kind to them and to yourself. Make it a slow transition rather than a big shift. Drop pasta first, then cut back on breads. 

**2.Make it their Paleo diet, not yours.** 

Learn about the Paleo diet and give your kids the facts. Help them to notice how foods make them feel by asking them. Once they say out loud that they feel stronger and more energized (in whatever terms they use), it becomes true. 

**3.Find flavors and textures to fill up the empty holes.** 

You may not be able to replace every texture and taste, but you can find foods that are satisfying in their own right. Emphasize those foods, even if it means you have to wait to introduce a wider variety. If putting kale chips on everything with a side of Paleo ranch makes them happy, so be it for the time being. 

**4.Meander toward your goal.** 

Keep your priorities in mind, but don’t make it the focus of every dinner 

conversation, shopping trip, or menu-planning session. 

**5.Let them choose.** 

Knowing in advance what you’ll be cooking is good for your sanity. That’s where the menu plan comes in. If you involve everyone in planning, you are far more likely to find the foods and dishes they will all enjoy. Then, menu in hand and lists at the ready, take them with you to the supermarket. Be prepared to point out all the good choices and let them choose. 

**6.Set a good example.** 

Let them see you stretch your horizons by trying new combinations and fla- vors. And if you have a craving for something you normally don’t eat, be hon- est. It is most effective if your honesty ends by saying something like “and so, instead of the Friday-afternoon pizza at the office, I broke out my famous trail mix and popped cauliflower.” (It’s even better if you can say that every- one loved them—and should that moment ever come, they will!) 

**7.Don’t sweat the small stuff.** 

If lunches come back partially eaten, it probably isn’t meant as an insult or a complaint. Maybe they were not really hungry when it was time for lunch. 

**8.Be prepared for parties.** 

Birthday parties, cookouts, picnics, and class trips can all pose a challenge. 

Talk to the host or hostess and offer to bring something that you know your kids will eat. Chances are the other kids will enjoy it too. 

**9.Tell them to blame it all on you.** 

If the other kids wonder why your kids don’t eat bread or spaghetti, let them blame it on you. Don’t be surprised if your kids’ lunches look much more interesting than most things put between two slices of white bread. 

**10.Be consistent by being prepared.** 

Remove the foods you don’t want to serve from your pantry, refrigerator, and freezer, and restock with Paleo foods that you can use to create meals, snacks, and treats in the same amount of time as it takes to get take-out pizza.

Paleo,[BlogSpam] 20 Minute Paleo Sesame Beef,"Beef is my favorite protein. This 20 minute Sesame Beef will make this nutritious protein be even more flavorful. A few ingredients and a few minutes will turn plain beef into a juicy delicacy.

This dish is a simple stir fry made with a savory sauce. It goes great with any vegetable, but I chose to use celery and bell pepper. The celery provides a robust crunch while the peppers give a subtle sweetness to the 20-minute Sesame Beef.

The sauce for this 20-minute Sesame Beef is prepared with coconut aminos, sesame oil, water, and arrowroot powder. The coconut aminos are a soy sauce substitute. If you can tolerate soy sauce feel welcome to use it. Meanwhile, the arrowroot is a thickening agent. This will make the sauce sticky and resemble that Chinese takeout.

The flavors are potent and so are the nutrients. The recipe uses ginger and garlic. Both of these ingredients provide nutrients which help [reduce inflammation](https://www.livestrong.com/article/250817-benefits-of-garlic-ginger/). On top of that, the sesame oil used in the recipe also delivers fats that are [good for heart health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587404/).

The nutrients are abundant in this 20 Minute Sesame Beef. On top of that the macronutrients are just as well rounded:

* Calories: 275
* Fats: 15

Paleo,[Discussion] “vegetable” oils/seed oils,"I posted about inflammation yesterday and these oils(soybean, canola...etc) were brought up, which I have been actively avoiding for the past year.

To those who avoid them, I’d like to discuss how you get around eating out when (most) restaurants use a mix of this crap.  Do you have any ordering strategies without seeming too weird/over the top with servers and people you’re eating out with?  

I have been avoiding social gatherings more and more recently because it usually involves eating out and I do not want to be in the social situation where “I’m special” and healthy and yada yada.  

Also, what common restaurants are oil friendly—so to speak.   For example, I was pleasantly surprised with chipotle’s ingredients.

I need some advice!

I have been sticking with a great paleo diet for the past six months, loving it, been having amazing results as far as general health improvements all around BUT I'm losing weight. 

I am 6'5, work out pretty heavily (4-5 days a week, mostly heavy lifts) and just can't seem to keep any weight on. My fat intake is good, energy levels are great, but again - just losing weight. I know my calories need to go up but they need to go up in a paleo way.

Done paleo for 4 months now and overall have felt amazing but have noticed a large drop in energy levels - I have noticed that as the months have gone by I have been more and more strict about sugar - stopped eating fruit, paleo baked goods, don't even eat many sweet potato now. 

My theory is my carb intake is too low? Better to go full keto, which I don't want to do, or eat more berries and sweet potato, etc. Anybody else experience this and more carbs helped? 

One thing to note is I work out quite intensely so that may be a difference in needing the extra carbs.

Paleo,[Question] Circadian Living?,"Considering the interest in eating in line with evolutionary development like paleo and intermittent fasting (sync'd to your circadian rhythm), I got to wondering if anyone is being as restrictive with artificial light.

To clarify, what I am suggesting is eliminating artificial light between sunset and sunrise. Go to bed at sunset (or, I guess, huddle with a candle) and rise with the sun. Oddly enough, I can't find anything on it (as a lifestyle). I figured asking here was a good start. It seems impossible that people aren't exploring this.

I would rather eat fruit than sweets or junk food any day, but my fiance LOVES baked sweets. Is there a good resource that list all of the things I need to keep in the pantry to make paleo versions of sweets? Is this recommended in the first place?

What things in particular did you replace with a paleo version because you just couldn't give it up? We are big bread and rice people, but we've found cauliflower rice to be delicious. We're a little wary of paleo bread, how does it compare to regular gluten baked bread?

Does anyone have a quick efficient system for cooking and storing meals? We will have to take our meals to our respective jobs if we want to eat paleo all day, I have some ideas but I'm sure others have come up with some equally as good or better. 

My fiance will be giving up proccessed sugar like coke and Pepsi, and I will be giving up coffee. Does anyone have any advice to get us through the first week or two? I know getting off sugar can be a wild ride, and I'm worried about migraines because I've had 2-3 cups of coffee every day for years now. 

Cheat days? Do you usually do one or two? Do you usually have any? After a month and a half of paleo, do cheat days tear up your stomach? 

I lift four times a week, doing powerlifting. Will most paleo meals provide me the nutrients I need? Can I still take protein? Can I make a paleo protein power? Should I not even worry about it because most paleo meals are high protein?

All of the prices were very good.  I bought some chicken hearts from them.  The price was absurdly low, like $1.63 per pound.

Also, I found that Costco is selling monkfruit in bulk.  I forget the price,  but it was competitive enough for me to lust after, but since I have several months worth of stevia left I don't remember the exact price.   But once my stevia is done, I am done with stevia and will be buying  Costco monkfruit.

Paleo,[Discussion] Restarting Paleo and I am incredibly hungry,"So some years ago (2013 or so) I went full Paleo, lost about 40 pounds easily. Went from 235 to around 195 fairly quickly, I'm 6 foot tall, and broad shouldered so 195 is a good weight for me. I kept the weight down for years, but long story short: I've been working a lot lately, eating crappy food because it's convenient (lots of sandwiches and pizza), and now I'm back up around 225 again. Decided to go back to paleo and I forgot how hard it was to start the diet.

I am starving all the time. The last three days I have been ravenous. I ate eggs and sausage with black coffee (no sugar) for breakfast the last three days, and before I could get to lunch I was already hungry. At lunch I ate a big bowl of pork stir fry with onions, bell peppers, and kale for the last two days (big serving I made that was also dinner), and then before I left work I was hungry again.

Yesterday I ate a salad as soon as I got off work, then made pork chops with sweet potato fries and cabbage for dinner (with leftovers for today's lunch). Now it's morning, already had breakfast (sausage and eggs as I mentioned), lunch is more than two hours away, but once more, I am already feeling hungry.

I've got no questions or other insights, really. Just felt like complaining somewhere online to people who might understand. I totally forgot how hungry you get when first starting paleo, which is true I suppose for a lot of dietary changes.

Paleo,[Question] Spouses/Partners/S.O.s - Paleo/Vegetarian,"This is more a relationship question than a diet question. I’ve been what I think is called “paleo adjacent” for a few years, but in January I went all in (chicken, fish, occasional beef, nuts, raw fruits and veggies only). Lost weight, not bloated, sleeping better, etc., etc. But my wife is a vegetarian (has been since before we met) and she is REALLY upset that I no longer want to eat the rice, tofu, etc., dishes that she likes to cook and eat. Upset to the extent that this causes arguments, and she even brought up divorce recently; luckily we have no children, but I really love her and think we can make it work. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we have gone out to eat in the 15+ years we’ve been together, we ALWAYS have different meals - she gets a vegetarian dish, and I usually have a good steak or seafood or something. But she’s now saying that a vital part of our marriage is us eating the same food at home for dinner. She does NOT address the hypothetical question of how she would respond if I said that she needed to each the chicken and beef that I cook in order for us to be a happy couple. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very tempted to make a throw-away Reddit account and post to one of the vegetarian sub-reddits as a woman saying she recently became vegetarian but that her husband was upset that she no longer wants to eat the steaks that he loves to cook and says she need to not be a vegetarian for the sake of their marriage. I am 98+% positive that in that scenario the hypothetical husband would be rightfully scorned. “My body, my choice”, right? Few things are as personal or as intimate as a reasoned decision about what we eat. 

&amp;#x200B;

So PLEASE, if anybody has any suggestions on how to deal with this, or has gone through something like this before, let me know how you addressed this. I found this great thread from last month:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/av1te1/discussion\_cooking\_paleo\_with\_a\_nonpaleo\_spouse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/av1te1/discussion_cooking_paleo_with_a_nonpaleo_spouse/)

&amp;#x200B;

But it didn’t address how to deal with the non-paleo spouse is vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

FYI, I definitely AM looking at dishes that I can cook that we both would enjoy (I mostly only eat animal protein at two of my three daily meals, so I could find some paleo-friendly vegetarian options for dinner and make that for us, and share the recipes with her).

Does anyone have any advice or wisdom?","Like the title says, every time I try to go strictly paleo, I just feel...off. And not in a good way. I do like the way I feel for the most part—I feel slimmer, less bloated, I tend to wake up earlier and I tend to have more motivation.  But I also tend to feel a bit...foggy? Clouded? Borderline-dizzy without ACTUALLY being dizzy? It feels similar to low-key motion sickness that I can’t shake. My typical meals look like this, give or take:

Breakfast (if I eat it): a few slices of bacon, a palmful of nuts, a few eggs, water. 

Lunch: a packet (or two) of tuna, a salad with a couple hard boiled eggs (vinegar and olive oil), a banana, and water. 

Dinner: two smallish bison patties with lettuce, onion, (paleo) ketchup and a salad on the side (olive oil and vinegar dressing), sometimes with some more nuts or a banana with a nut-butter. 

Occasionally I’ll eat a few pieces of bacon as a snack, or maybe some fruit here and there. I can’t explain the feeling. Something just feels off. I imagine it’s similar to what low blood sugar feels like (almost shaky feeling, kinda foggy, but I’m NOT hungry) but i have checked my blood sugar on multiple accounts thinking that was the issue and my blood sugar is fine. Are my carbs too low? Am I missing something vital? I don’t drink as much water as I probably should, but I do drink more water being paleo than I ever had not being paleo. 
I always go back to eating non-paleo because every time I go paleo to try again, I just feel weird and off. Any advice or instruction would be appreciated. ",1554259683

Paleo,[Question] Wondering about commercial oils?,"I have been mostly on a keto form of paleo for over 5 years. Lately out of boredom I suppose, I have started using products made from commercial oils (soybean mostly), like Helman's mayonaise, and Kraft Caesar salad dressing. This does not compromise my fat macro and is considered ok in keto circles, but I remember from my paleo reading a few years back, commercial vegetable oils are not so good for us. Is it really that big of a deal to use them? What sort of damage can they possibly cause?",1554135821

Paleo,"[Discussion]Just how essential are ""essential fatty acids"".","I'm sure everyone in this community is aware of how debated the topic of polyunsaturated vs saturated fat is. The medical journals always yield us contradictory and confusing messages. This is not simply a topic where citing research shows a clear answer. I figured taking a step back and looking at what happens to the organism as a whole could yield us better answers. 

So the pro-polyunsaturated argument generally states that these fats are essential to consume because we can't make them ourselves. To someone with no biochemical background, this would sound like a pretty straightforward assumption. This dates all the way back to 1929 when the Burrs published a study showing that unsaturated fats, especially linoleic acid, are essential to prevent a particular disease involving dermatitis, slowed growth, sterility, and fatal kidney diseases. 

But wait, is the whole idea that these fats are ""essential"" reside on the shoulders of a study done in the late 1920s. Further more, in the 1920s most of the B vitamins hadn't even been discovered yet. The fact these rats were possibly lacking other essential nutrients is something most of the pro PUFA crowd hasn't even taken into consideration. Also worth noting that in 1927, two years before the Burr study, [Bernstine and Elias showed evidence that suggested a fat free diet prevented the growth of cancer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02123099).

So as you can see, this idea of EFAs is becoming more and more shaky as we keep getting deeper. The Burrs didn't account for other nutritional deficiencies, and there's studies contradicting their message of fatty acid essentially. Also in humans, [an extremely low fat diet (0.03 grams of fat per kilogram of body weight) doesn't seem to yield any negative results over a 6 month period, actually a few positive results](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/16/6/511/4727031?redirectedFrom=PDF). But okay, what about the heart health implications of replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats? Surely this is settled science by now, right? Not exactly, firstly the immune suppression mechanism by which PUFA reduce LDL concentrations isn't exactly a net positive. There's many reasons why LDL can be temporarily elevated, one of them being a bacterial/viral infection. PUFAs immune suppression qualities have long been known by the medical community as well. It use to be used in a emulsion given to patients who received an organ transplant. It suppresses then immune system giving a greater chance the organ won't be rejected. 

Dr. William Lands, one of the world's most prominent researchers in EFAs, has also been on record stating their essentially is greatly exaggerated, and as little as 1% of caloric intake from PUFA is all that's needed to meet the average person's daily requirement. 1% is exceedingly low, and on a standard 2,000 calorie diet would be roughly 2 grams of polyunsaturated fat a day. You could practically meet this recommendation by eating 1 egg fried in a 1/2 tbsp of butter. 

So far we've established PUFAs and their ""essential"" role in our health is severely questionable, and just for arguments sake if they are essential the amount we need to meet the daily requirement is so low that we don't even need to prioritize this issue. Because short of eating a laboratory made diet, we're going to meet that 1% daily intake, likely much more than 1% for many of us. But is their any evidence to suggest dietary intake of PUFA can be actively harmful? Well, yeah their is. Lipid peroxidation is a central issue in regards to PUFA [1](https://www.pnas.org/content/97/2/611) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892483/). There's also some evidence to suggest replacing omega 6 fatty acids react unfavorably with inflammation, because they're precursors to certain inflammatory prostaglandins. Replacing them with omega 3 fatty acids is thought to be less inflammatory [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12578976). PUFAs, when incorporated into cell membranes, make cells more fluid, which makes them chaotropic, disorderly and reduces their function [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3030452). The increase in fluidity will allow more water, sodium, chloride, and calcium into the cell (edema), and lower intracellular potassium and magnesium which will also destabilize the cell, and reduce cellular function. Metabolic processes cannot occur optimally in such an environment. This increase in fluidity increases excitation, and proliferation (tumor growth) or cell death. But probably one of the most pronounced toxic effects of PUFA is their ability to inhibit the crucial thyroid enzyme *thyroid* *peroxidase* [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740614/). 

So, just to recap the entire analysis of PUFA and their role in human health and metabolism. The main pro PUFA research dates all the way back to the late 20s, there's circumstantial reasoning to suggest they didn't account for B vitamin deficiencies in that study, and there's some contradictory studies around the same time to suggest rats were not only able to live on an entirely fat free diet, but they were more resistant to cancer as well. Also there's the fact that 1% of our caloric intake seems sufficient enough to not get the symptoms of EFA deficiency. Or maybe, another way of looking at it, 1% PUFA intake is simply inhibiting our metabolisms enough to prevent a hypermetabolic rate, which would make our daily nutritional requirements impractical. The one bad side to high metabolisms is we generate a lot of heat and burn through nutrient stores much quicker. So maybe a slight metabolism inhibition could be seen as a good thing. PUFAs may be able to lower our LDLs, but it comes at the cost of suppressing our immune systems. They also contribute to lipid peroxidation, inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis, and inhibit thyroid function. At this point, I've heard all I need to hear, and choose to not only limit PUFA intake, but proactively avoid it to the best of my ability. Because even the consumption of coconut oil and butter, which is around 2 and 3 percent linoleic acid, is enough to meet that 1% threshold. 

Now there's the saturated fat, and how they play a the role in human health. As an opening defense to saturated fat I think it's important to take a step back and examine mammals as a whole. I don't care where you look, every warm blooded mammal has a high degree of saturation in their adipose tissues. We store saturated fatty acids for a reason, they're more stable to our warm blooded nature. If we were amphibious cold blooded organisms, then this would be a horse of a different color. Mammals also have a high degree of saturation in our mitochondria, and we expose ourselves to increasingly higher amounts of unsaturated fat, our cells become more fluid like, causing our metabolisms to slow down. Probably the most compelling case to recognize the importance of saturated fatty acids is realizing we will synthesize them on a very low fat diet. If you eat a low fat, high carb, diet we will use fatty acid synthesis which is an internal mechanism for converting glucose, to acetyl-CoA, into various saturated fatty acids. Primarily converted into palmitic and stearic acids. Stearic acid can further be desaturated into monounsaturated fats as well. So I think it's important for people to realize the so called bad, unessential fats in the mainstream are the fats our bodies will go out of their way to make, even if we're not consuming them directly. In a funny way, you could put a very good argument forward to suggest saturated fat is indeed the **only** essential fatty acid. I'm getting tired now, so for the closer in my rant about this topic I'll address the common misconception that saturated fat is somehow related to heart disease. The glaring obvious fact I always notice in these debates that put saturated fat under the microscope is that none of the critics ever take into account the cholesterol turnover rate. Cholesterol's main jobs in the body is to convert itself into bile acids and convert itself into pregnenolone for downstream steroid synthesis. To do both these jobs sufficiently the body needs adequate vitamin A and adequate thyroid hormone. When were lacking just one of these, the cholesterol turnover rate decrease and we start having a habitually higher serum cholesterol (LDL) value. This has nothing to do with saturated fat, and more to do with either a micronutrient deficient diet, or a lack of active thyroid hormone due to either genetics, PUFAs, low carb diets, etc. When subjects with high cholesterol are supplemented with thyroid they see a sharp decline in their cholesterol [1](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/101024/pdf). It's glaringly obvious to me that an individual's metabolic rate, or lack thereof, is responsible for people's high cholesterol. It's why one person can eat butter everyday of their life and die at 42 of a heart attack, and another person can eat butter everyday of their life and not die until 95. Walt Kempner also provided the scientific community with some very important findings when he put his patients on the rice diet and many of their chronic illnesses where reversed. His diet was much less important than the underlying mechanism he discovered, which was a reduction in serum free fatty acids tends to heal the organism. Well the main cause of excess serum FFAs is an excess amount of stress hormones, particularly adrenaline and cortisol. Which thyroid normally keeps in check, but when lacking the stress metabolism will elevate to compensate for the thyroid deficiency. So thyroid, and circulating free fatty acids, play a much bigger role in process that leads up to coronary heart disease than saturated fat. Broda Barnes was a medical doctor who had 1,500+ patients over a 20 year period, he didn't control their diet, exercise, cholesterol ,or smoking but he was still able to prevent and reverse 94% of heart disease and 100% of diabetes just by giving his patients a desiccated thyroid supplement. Given the parameters of his study, and purposefully not adjusting for co-factors like diet and smoking, Barnes's study is absolutely one of the most solid cases for determining cause and cure of heart disease. 

Given all this, it should be noted that when you have chronically high LDL levels it's likely a sign of poor thyroid function. And a safer, not to mention more efficient way, of lowering your LDL is to take desiccated thyroid not statin medication which is masking a symptom and not addressing the cause. Other notable ways to lower cholesterol is supplementing pregnenolone, activated charcoal, and niacin. Getting the PUFA, grains, and legumes out of the diet and focusing on lean meats, eggs, veggies, fruits, and starchy tubers is also a move in the right direction. Make sure you're getting other coronary markers checked as well. Lp(a), CRP, LDH, homocysteine, and ferritin are perhaps just as important if not more important at judging cardiac risk factor than just LDL.

Paleo,[Discussion]Very first prototype of cheap ($5) paleo + keto nutritionally complete meal. (Omelet + Trail Mix),"All right, so this is the very first  prototype of my meal idea. I'm eating it to see how practical it is, and  so far so good. Not the most amazing meal but consider the  restrictions. :)

It is keto, and paleo.  
It is free of gluten, grain, legumes, diary, preservatives or added sugar.

It's  1900 calories that contain all the nutritional needs for the day.   Vitamins, Minerals, amino acids, and Omega 3 fatty acids, fiber and   protein for around $5. The omega 3 to 6 ratio is a minimum of 1:4

Super  easy to make, in theory: you'd have two packets. One you add to   boiling water and then add 6 scrambled eggs too. The other is just a mix   of seeds/nuts and is ready to eat.

All products are whole, initially raw, and minimally processed and easy to verify that it is the real deal.

You can't make counterfeit nuts profitably; unlike all of the adulterated olive oils and other products.  
This  is because it is very hard for the end user to verify highly processed  products. You just have to trust companies like Heul and Soylent.  They're probably honest, but certainly many food products, like olive  oil, are adulterated and not up to the standards they claim. Supposedly  nearly 70% of olive oil fails quality control in one way or another for  what they are being marketed as.

Admittedly  this isn't the most amazing tasting meal, but you can dress  it up with  butter, spices, salsa, etc and that's pretty decent.

Few  food combinations meet the restrictions I've placed on this: complete  nutrition, keto, paleo, cheap and easy to make, and easy to validate  quality.

Recipe:

Trail Mix Portion:  
Hazelnuts 10.7 grams  
Almonds 28.3 grams  
Sunflower Seeds 50 grams  
Pumpkin Seed 50 grams  
Hemp Seeds  50 grams

Omelet Portion:  
Sun Dried Tomatoes 1.5 grams  
Freeze Dried Green Sweet Peppers 6.9 grams  
Spinach 27.6grams  
Bacon Bits 50 grams  
Clams 2.1grams  
Eggs 300 grams (6 Large eggs)  
Dried Shiitake 19.4 grams

I  used linear optimization from a bunch of nutrition and price data  scraped from the web, and set certain limitations to make for a  palatable meal; cheaper options exist, but it's like 6,000 calories of  chia seeds and sunflower seeds which is totally impractical and too many  calories.

Hello,

today is my first day with paleo. I want to boost my genereal health and a problem with my leg (pain) - no doc could help me so far. I'm hoping it will get fixed as soon as my body is healing better which is what im hoping to get from paleo.

Anyway, i've red quite about it so far but i am not sure how i should start... Some say i should eat less fructose. The thing is: I usually dont eat a breakfast (dont like it, especially not when going to work) and, because of paleo, i probably can't eat a proper meal at work either. That would probably bring me to some fruit during the day and a big meal on the evening. Is that okay?

Also, there is a thing like Paleo-AIP - should i try to start with that? It seems like that would be so much to avoid additionally...

Is it okay to eat potatoes? There are different opinions on that too i think?

Paleo,[Question] Food substitutions to lower cholesterol and blood pressure,"Hi,

I've been following a Paleo-ish diet for a long time now, over 5 years. My blood tests have always showed high cholesterol though. I just had one done and got these numbers:

* Cholesterol: 261
* HDL: 75
* LDL: 163
* Triglycerides: 115
* LDL/HDL ratio: 2.17
* Chol/HDL ratio: 3.48

&amp;#x200B;

All other numbers are fine and in normal ranges. I've gained some weight lately and my blood pressure has never been great and my cholesterol numbers haven't really changed since 2016.

My question is, what can I eat on a Paleo diet to help these numbers? Current diet is:

* Breakfast: 3 eggs w/ butter. Coffee
* Lunch: Salad w/ fish, olive oil, feta cheese, sometimes avocado
* Snack: Cheese, almond crackers, nuts, Larabar, potato chips, taro chips, salsa
* Dinner: Meat (usually pork or beef), vegetable, squash/sweet potato
* Drinks (need to cut down, esp on weekends): 1-2 beers, 1-2 glasses wine, mixed drink w/ soda water &amp; lime/lemon juice

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't measured it out, but I'm eating pretty high fat, low carb most of the day until I get home which is probably the worst time to eat/drink carbs. I also wonder some days if I really eat enough calories: by the time I get home I'm really hungry most days. Exercise has been recently limited due to an injury but I eat the same amount of food most of the time, probably more nuts/cheese when I'm hungry.

Paleo,[blogspam] Kitchen Sink Frittata,"EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK

A Kitchen Sink Frittata is a simple concept: A frittata stuffed with everything imaginable, or “everything but the kitchen sink.” As such, it has an incredibly flexible ingredient list aside from the necessary eggs. It can be easily adjusted to accommodate Paleo, Keto, SIBO, and Whole30 diets, as well as many food allergies and intolerances. It’s also a great way to use up extra veg hanging out in your produce drawer that will inevitably end up in the compost bin if you don’t use it asap.

For extra protein, I generally add sugar-free bacon, ground sausage, chorizo, or ground turkey. I also love adding a generous amount of cheese; sharp cheddar, gouda, gruyere, and pepper jack are my favs. If you’re completely meat or dairy free, this recipe can also be made without, but I highly suggest adding in fun extras that will liven the dish up. Cilantro, chives, or dried red pepper can add significant punch to the dish when you’re working around a food allergy or intolerance. If I’m feeling fancy, I’ll top them with a few avocado slices and/or a drizzle of [Paleo sriracha](https://www.stevespaleogoods.com/paleochef-sriracha-p/chef-sriracha.htm) after they’re baked.

I suppose I can't reconcile why exactly sunflower seeds, for example, are more paleo than corn (maize) kernels when neither seem to have been utilized by hunter-gatherer societies. Moreover, both of those plants (and their edible parts) have been drastically altered by selective breeding. Of course, my understanding is rooted in the idea that Paleo refers strictly to the diet of our ancestors before agriculture changed the way we eat. What am I missing?",1552854487

Paleo,[Question] Am I the only one?," So I (F26|5'5""|SW:197|CW:192) have been doing paleo for over a month and strict for 15 days now, no cheating, and I've never gone over 17000 (which is my basal metabolic rate)((yes I track my calories!!)). I lost 6 lbs last month doing strict paleo with small cheats on Saturdays. Like, I would be paleo all day but I would eat one chocolate chip cookie, or one chicken tender that day, and then straight back to paleo for the next 6-7 days. To get to the point: I have been stuck at the exact same weight for 15 days, and I KNOW I am under calories every day. Does anyone else feel like their body just adjusts to whatever calories they are getting and just holds onto the weight? This happens to me every time I do a diet: keto, I lost 10 lbs in the first two weeks and then didn't lose any weight for 2 months, OMAD, I lost 5 lbs in the first 2 weeks, and then I stopped losing weight for the following weeks. I work out 3-4 times a week (HIIT) and try my best to get 10,000 steps a day. Is anyone else out there like me? I know all the normal advice: ""CICO"", and ""weightloss isn't linear"" and ""you're just on a plateau"". I've been to weightloss clinics, gotten my thyroid checked, had b12 injections for 12 weeks, talked to eastern medicine doctors, I feel like I am just doomed to stay at my weight (technically obese for my height). I guess I am trying to see if there are any other tactics I should be using? ",1552662822

Why not just take all that nature had to give us I keep thinking to myself.

I remember telling friend of mine about me eating a strict paleo diet a few years ago. “Yep it’s a diet of only plants, meats, fish, eggs and nuts”

Paleo,[BlogSpam] Bacon Beef Paleo Spaghetti,"Spaghetti is a hearty and tasty meal. This Bacon Beef Spaghetti is more than savory, it is packed with protein. This simple sauce transforms a few ingredients into a vehicle of vitamins and minerals. This Bacon Beef Spaghetti is a great option for meal prep or as a stand-alone dish.

&amp;#x200B;

This Bacon Beef Spaghetti is inspired by the Amatriciana Pasta. This Italian dish originated right outside of Rome and consists of a sauce made with pork belly, onions, and tomatoes. The recipe varies from family to family, but that is it in a nutshell. My mom always prepared it for me when I was growing up.

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that this Bacon Beef Spaghetti is paleo and keto friendly. We make it from scratch with good ingredients. All of which are nutrient dense. I used ground venison in mine, but you can use ground beef. I recommend using lean ground beef since you will be adding bacon. About the bacon, I used uncured bacon. This type has a better taste and it also contains fewer ingredients than regular bacon.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a paleo dish and paleo is healthy. Right? Then why is there bacon?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, bacon is for the flavor which is number one when it comes to sticking with your diet and goals. Bacon is actually a [decent source of minerals](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/pork-products/7676/2) such as selenium and phosphorus. Be aware however this doesn’t mean that you can eat all the bacon in the world, it is still a very calorie dense food.

&amp;#x200B;

This Bacon Beef Spaghetti packs some minerals and vitamins. Not to mention the protein content. These are the macros for this dish:

* Calories: 320
* Fats: 18
* Carbs: 5
* Protein: 29

With an excellent caloric content, this Beef Bacon Spaghetti packs a punch as far as protein and healthy fats go. If you would like to have it be fewer calories, simply choose a lump of leaner ground meat or use turkey bacon. I recommend eating within 4 days.

I hope you enjoy!

Paleo,Going paleo/keto has helped me with so much.. but I still have DANDRUFF. Please read/help!," I have had bad dandruff for YEARS, like this layer of white sludge that forms on my scalp between hair washes. Since going paleo/keto/carnivore my toenail fungus has healed itself, also not wearing close-toed slippers in the house probably significantly contributed to that healing. I just switched to open toed sandals. Before that I had tried EVERYTHING to get rid of the toenail fungus except pharmaceuticals, none of it worked. Same goes for the dandruff. I hoped going keto would help but nothing has changed. The only thing that seems to have helped in the past is not using soap or shampoo, only a baking soda + water wash, followed by an apple cider vinegar rinse. But the baking soda was not good on my hair, apparently it coats hair in a highly unideal way, and it got all brittle. My dandruff was better but never went away completely. I recently switched back to a normal shampoo and now I’m back to the previous levels of horrible dandruff. One thing my hairdresser suggested that made a lot of sense is blow-drying the scalp after washing so hot moist hair isn’t sitting on the scalp all night, which made a lot of sense.

My question is, do you see any nutritional value in substituting a “paleo brownie” loaded with coconut sugar, maple syrup, etc? Does coconut sugar/maple syrup make any difference to you, or do you consider them equilivent to cane sugar/corn syrup, etc?",1551229326

I was in the best shape of my life and felt on top of the world but since we've been together I slowly caved and over the years ended up on his diet (processed foods, high carbs etc...) I've recently decided to make the change back to paleo but my question is, is there anyone here whose spouse/family eats the same way as he does and how do you merge your diets to be able to eat dinners as a family? I'm the cook most of the time and I try to do things like add rice on the side for him but he finds paleo boring (because it's not full of preservatives and added flavouring) and he always complains it'll make him lose weight (He's a body builder). Do you cook separate meals? Are there any paleo-friendly carb-heavy recipe ideas you could share that I could make for him? Are there any grains or ingredients you would allow yourself on paleo? Quinoa perhaps? I hope in time he'll slowly start eating better with me but for now I just want to make dinner time as seamless as possible! ",1551200999

Paleo,[BlogSpam] Chicken in a Creamy Chipotle Sauce,"Chicken and chipotle sounds like a tasty combination. This 20 Minute Creamy Chipotle Chicken is paleo, quick, and easy to fix. Only a handful of ingredients and one hot pan will transform plain chicken breast into a protein flavor grenade.

This recipe is a simple combination of zesty, smoky, and creamy. All within the paleo protocols and using easy to find ingredients. This 20 minute creamy chipotle chicken is something that will make you love chicken!

For the creamy part of the chicken, I used coconut milk. This will provide some richness, tame the chipotle heat, and add some good fats. The chipotles came canned in adobo sauce. I normally get a brand that has a minimal amount of ingredients and sugar. Then, I seasoned my chicken with a rub that blends in with the creamy chipotle sauce.

The nutrition for this 20 minute creamy chipotle chicken is loaded with protein. This essential macronutrient is fundamental for muscle development. Not only that, but it is also essential to prevent muscle loss. Chicken is packed with all essential amino acids which help you [recover from workouts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22150425) and keep your muscles healthy.

The macros for a 4 ounce (100 gram)  serving of the 20 minute creamy chipotle chicken are the following:

* Calories: 250
* Fats: 14
* Carbs: 6
* Protein: 25

With only 4 ounces you get a lot of protein! This creamy chipotle chicken is well balance with complete protein and healthy fats. I recommend eating it within 4 days. Enjoy it with your choice of vegetables or cauliflower rice.

2. Was thinking about sourcing the liver from [Grassland Beef](https://grasslandbeef.com/beef-liver-1-pound-package), but they only sell in 1 lb quantities.

Paleo,[Discussion] Tanning Bed in Winter. Good idea? Best UVA/UVB ratio and other requirements?,"I have seen quite a few people recommend tanning during the winter months, especially up here in Canada to help with Vitamin D and other benefits from the sun. I couldn't care less about a tan. My want is to feel great all winter. I am reaching out to see if anyone knows where I can dig a bit deeper into which lights are the most appropriate at getting as natural as possible light to achieve the optimum benefits with the least potential damage.

What I have learned so far:

1. ""Low Pressure"" tanning beds usually have a bit more UVB so thats where to go vs the high pressure UVA fast tan beds. The author of ""The Vitamin D solution"" seems to be on board with these low pressure lights. 
2. We should use a UBA/UVB Ratio that mimics midday sun..I think? Not sure what that ratio is.
3. I have seen from some other threads that suggest there is much more than just the UVA/UVB Ratio but I cannot find this information. If you know anything please share
4. Lastly, from what I can tell, the tanning industry has changed quite a bit for the better. Used to be just UVA now there is a mix in most lights especially in the ""low pressure"" ones. So gone are the days of shitty orange looking winter tans (I think).

I also read one comment where someone suggested that old school CLEO RUVA lamps were the best.

And another person said these are the important questions we must be asking:

Important factors such as the quality of components used in manufacturing, the manufacturing process and the subsequent “shape” of the **output in mw/cm**² – ***across the UV spectrum –*** often go undisclosed. Where does the particular light deliver the majority of its mw/cm² on the UV spectrum?  Where is the UVB peak?  Where is the UVA peak?  At what voltage has the lamp been tested: 208, 220 or 240 volts?  What are the **real test results in mw/cm²,** how **high** are the peaks and **where** on the nanometer scale do they fall? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, any thoughts are greatly helpful. I'd love to eventually have a list of ""approved"" lights so I can check with a tanning salon to see the exact ""light"" being used in the tanning bed. Or maybe this is just a bad idea altogether. I don't know.",1550195352

Unfortunately, the beloved veggies are actually a BIG reason why people have leaky gut. But the main culprit is our SAD SAD diet. (I'm referring to the standard american diet of course).

If you have incessant chronic issues, this could be why....

*What is Leaky Gut? (It's not just two gross words together)*

🥩The small intestine is \~50% of your gut. It is responsible for 90% of food absorption and has the largest mass of immune cells in your entire body \[[\*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Healthy_Gut_Healthy_You.html?id=yd_jtAEACAAJ)\].

🥩The only barrier protecting what you eat from your bloodstream is just a single layer of mucous, linked together by proteins \[[\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5440529/)\]

🥩When this barrier is broken, it results in leaky gut. The lining of your gut is not HOLDING THE DOOOOORRR.

🥩Toxins like gluten and chemicals like arsenic or BPA to pass into your bloodstream. Rightfully so, your body freaks out.

🥩Your immune system is mobilized to expel the toxins, which creates inflammation throughout your body (not just in the gut).

*Symptoms of Leaky Gut / Long Term Consequences*

🥩33% of autoimmune disorders are already linked to leaky gut. Type 1 diabetes, for example, is an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your pancreas. \[[\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22109896)\]

🥩Cancer: The team at Paleomedicina showed that leaky gut may be accompanied by permeability in other membranes too, like the arteries and blood brain barrier \[[\*](https://www.paleomedicina.com/en/ketogenic_diet_review_comment_paleomedicina)\]

🥩Food sensitivities (this is both a cause and an effect)

🥩Skin issues like acne and eczema

🥩Gut issues like IBS

🥩Alzheimers: When intestinal permeability increases, toxins pass through the bloodstream and to the brain through the vagus nerve. This triggers inflammation, which can cause a breakdown in cognitive function \[[\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28372330)\]

🥩Anxiety and Depression (also through vagus nerve and BBB permeability)

*What Causes Leaky Gut? Two main things:*

🥩Inflammation: Diet or stress related

🥩Certain foods directly degrade the gut lining: alcohol, gluten, saponins, nightshades and lectin are all examples

*Why Paleo / Carnivore Diet Cures It*

🥩It cuts out the main dietary triggers: FODMAPs, Gluten, Poisonous veggies, sugar, alcohol, etc.

🥩It can actually heal the gut

🥩Meat and ketone production reduces inflammation. Very few people are intolerant to meat

🥩Protein protects the intestinal barrier: Among the many amino acids, glutamine and tryptophan have been reported to maintain, promote, and protect intestinal barrier function. Glutamine, one of the nonessential amino acids, is a major energy source for intestinal epithelial cell \[[\*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00018-012-1070-x)\]

🥩Omega 3's help to heal the gut: Omega-3s reverse gut imbalances — dysbiosis — and increase the production of anti inflammatory compounds.

🥩Vitamins D and A improve the cohesion of the intestinal wall: Vitamin D helps improve the strength of the protein junctions between intestinal cells  \[[\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2830290/)\]. Vitamin A has also been shown to increase the intestinal defense layer \[[\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2830290/)\]. Eat beef liver!

Paleo,"Neoglyptatelus uruguayensis • A New Species of Neoglyptatelus (Xenarthra, Cingulata) from the Late Miocene of Uruguay Provides New Insights on the Evolution of the Dorsal Armor in Cingulates"," The genus Neoglyptatelus Carlini, Vizcaíno and Scillato-Yané has been  considered a member of Glyptatelinae, a group encompassing the  purportedly basal-most glyptodonts. It is up to now represented by two  species from Colombia: *Neoglyptatelus* originalis Carlini,  Vizcaíno and Scillato-Yané, from the middle Miocene (a carapace  fragment, isolated osteoderms and postcranial bones), and *Neoglyptatelus sincelejanus* Villarroel  and Clavijo, from the middle or late Miocene (a partial carapace and a  caudal armor). More scarce material assigned to this genus was recovered  from the late Miocene of Uruguay and Brazil. In this article, we  describe **a new species,** ***Neoglyptatelus uruguayensis***,  from the late Miocene Camacho Formation, Uruguay, based on an almost  complete carapace and several postcranial bones. We conducted a  phylogenetic analysis based on 167 morphological characters (23 new ones  and 144 from previous analysis) scored for 19 taxa, encompassing some  of the best known glyptodontid genera, one pampathere and four  armadillos (including the enigmatic genus *Pachyarmatherium* Downing and White). In the most parsimonious tree that was obtained, *Neoglyptatelus* forms a clade with *Pachyarmatherium* (Pachyarmatheriidae),  which is the sister group of the glyptodonts + pampatheres clade;  consequently, it is not a glyptodont, as previously believed. This  result, together with the known stratigraphic and geographic  distribution of *Neoglyptatelus* and *Pachyarmatherium*, suggests that this new cingulate clade originated in South America and that *Pachyarmatherium* reached North America during the Plio—Pleistocene. The carapace of *Neoglyptatelus* and *Pachyarmatherium* comprises  pelvic and scapular shields overlapping each other without separate  intervening transverse mobile bands, an arrangement that differentiates  both genera from the remaining cingulates.

This seemed like an excellent step. But he lost an alarming amount of weight from about 160 to 120 or 130 (although he wont let me know his exact weight now) he is 5'10 tall

Paleo,Do you blanch beef bones before making bone broth? [Question],"So I've got everything I need to make bone broth tomorrow and I have a few questions but the main one is do you guys recommend blanching the bones? I'm guessing not because every recipe which I've seen so far doesn't even mention that you can blanch the bones before you make the broth if you want. I found a link from some fancy cooking magazine or something and it recommended blanching the bones for better taste.    

So maybe it makes it taste better but could potentially decrease the nutritional value and that's why no recipe that I can find anywhere mentions it? That's my only guess anyway.",1548539717

Paleo,[question] who has tried Paleo AND food combining?,"I feel a hell of a lot better since going paleo about 2 months ago, its amazing. But I have noticed if I pay attention to food combining as well I feel even better and quite literally never have any digestive issues. BUT I also notice I get hungry/eat a lot more frequently so its kind of annoying to always be eating. Basic rules of food combining:

1 eating protein with veggies only (not with starches like sweet potato)

2 eatings starches with lots of fat 

3 eating fruit alone if at all (basically I don't eat much fruit)

Paleo,"[Question] Is paleo right for me? Also, what’s the point?","Like I’m not sure I get it. I don’t mean to seem like an asshole, but it seems kind of gimmicky? The whole point is to eat like you were hunting and gathering the food yourself. It’s healthier right? But you avoid things like dairy and grains. Those are pretty healthy, aren’t they? So instead of getting nutrients from milk or cheese or grains, you avoid them for the sole reason of “cavemen didn’t eat them”. I guess I’m just wondering exactly what the point is of avoiding these certain, somewhat healthy foods. I mean you guys can eat pickled food, spices, etc etc. Those weren’t around back then either. Why include those but not cheese? 

I’m genuinely curious, and pretty uniformed. I’d actually like to change my diet from a keto diet to something more substantial. I like the sound of paleo but I really don’t know if I “get” it. I’m totally down for skipping out on a lot of processed food that’s heavy heavy on the carbs and sugars cuz I’m used to that. I like the idea of being able to eat potatoes again. But to be honest I really don’t want to skip out on cheese haha. Is it still paleo if I eat cheese? How do you guys live without cheese?

**TLDR-is the whole point of paleo a gimmick? what’s the point of cutting out certain healthy food? Is paleo right for me?**

Again I know I probably sound like an asshole who just insulted your entire way of eating, but I would really like to be informed. 

Also I would have asked these questions in a subreddit chat room but I don’t think this subreddit has one? Could just not be showing up on mobile. ",1548406653
Paleo,[BlogSpam] Venison and Cassava Roast,"Venison and Yuca Roast sounds fancy, but this delicious recipe is probably one of the easiest you will ever make. Venison is a nutritious protein that when prepared properly it can be the best meal you’ve ever had. All it takes is a few key ingredients and patience for this magic to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we go any further, always remember that you can always swap the venison with beef! I understand that everyone cannot go hunt a deer. So for simplicity purposes, if you don’t have venison get a beef roast of your preference.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in this Venison and Yuca Roast, you have one key ingredient, Yuca. Similar to a potato, yuca is commonly consumed across South America where people use it in soups and other dishes. When adding to soups, it adds thickness and heartiness. Another name for yuca is cassava.

&amp;#x200B;

You can easily find yuca at various grocery stores. You can even find it in the middle of the heart of Appalachia! Some will carry it frozen and already peeled.  If you buy it fresh, I recommend watching this video on how to [peel it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emzabcpkHT8). When picking yuca, make sure it is hard and it has no smell.

&amp;#x200B;

Like all of my recipes, such as this one it’s loaded with nutrients! The yuca provides complex carbs alongside with plenty of vitamins. It contains a lot of vitamin C which aids in oxidative stress and [eliminating free radicals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614697/) from your body. On the flipside, the venison provides a hit of protein as well as minerals. One of these is Zinc. This [vital mineral](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3724376/) is essential for the brain, reproductive, and stomach health among others.

The macros for the Venison and Yuca Roast are the following:

* Calories: 240
* Fats: 10
* Carbs: 13
* Protein: 22

The Venison and Yuca Roast packs a punch with the healthy fats, complex carbs, and muscle building protein! I recommend eating it within 4 days for best taste. It is a simple dish with little spices, but the ingredients come together to give it a powerful flavor. Enjoy with [cauliflower rice](https://realricofitness.com/15-minute-golden-cauliflower-rice/) or oven roasted broccoli!

Paleo,I've read bone broth is supposed to be inexpensive to make but it seems expensive to me [question],"This may not be the best place to post this but I've been looking to make some beef bone broth after using the carton kind for several years. I started looking at recipes and they seem to call for about 5 lbs of bones, a local farm sells grassfed beef bones for $5 a lb in 5 lb cases. The recipe calls for 12 cups of water so even if none of this is lost that's like $10 for 4 cups (after buying vegetables) whereas the store bought kind is $6 for 4 cups. I read that making it yourself is supposed to save you money.    

I've heard you can reuse the bones but I don't know if they retain much nutrition after being cooked for a day, or maybe the store bought kind is watered down?",1548199289

They are easy to make and delicious.

I'm just wondering though, what can I do along these lines to add some more 'health' into such a snack?

My first thought is to add some LSA (ground-up linseed/sunflower/almond meal) to them, which wouldn't affect taste much but would add some nutrients and fibre.

I guess one could also do things like add blueberries or other berries in there.

I'm in good shape, I work out and run consistently, but I wanted to try Paleo to 1) get a bit leaner and 2) see if it helps me feel a bit healthier over all (reduce some of the brain fog and the bloating feeling I get when I'm on a diet eating a lot of wheat/grain/high sugar products).

That said, I'm unfortunatly a bit addicted to these post-dinner desserts now and I'm having a lot of trouble breaking the habit when the craving strikes. Are there any paleo-friendly desserts or things to munch on when an evening craving strikes could help me break my habit?

Paleo,[Discussion] I need too stop consuming so much meat how do i stop?,"Good morning friends of the paleo community. I have a serious problem with eating so much meat. I want to consume less but it seems impossible right now. Each time it feels like i eat more and more! I haven't even had vegetables in like 2 months. The stress and pressure from my ""dream job"" has caused me to gain 15 pounds in 5 months (ive been eating paleo this whole time its just that i have been completely overeating and just been thinking about my job even after i get out of work that i don't even have the motivation to exercise or do anything due to the anxiety). Because of this i have been super lazy in even buying vegetables any more because i don want to take the extra time and step to saute that spinach , roast that asparagus, steam that broccoli, slice that cucumber, or make that cauliflower rice. i have been eating anywhere from 36eggs a week 2 packs of chicken breasts or 3 packs of chicken thighs per week plus any other meat my parents might use in some of their dishes. Right now, it has just been so much easier to put the chicken on the griddle or oven and its just done, and eggs are just super quick to make. Last week i ate 7lbs of prime rib in 3 days! I need help eating less meat thank you! also please no more nuts i eat so many of those right now too and i know i havent been getting in enough water also unfortunately.",1548010660
Paleo,[Discussion] Why do I keep doing this to myself?,"Hey guys. So I've known about paleo since around 2013/14. I did it pretty seriously in 2017 and it was huge in helping my health (hashimotos/ hypothyroidism, which I've had since 11) and my acne. I had been underweight all my life until 22, when, by researching why was I having stomach pain and daily emergency visits to the bathroom (which made me lose a few pounds and I was already skinny) I found out gluten was pretty bad for a person with my health problems. So I quit gluten then and for the first time in my life was able to start putting weight. In hindsight, I regret I didn't get tested for celiac, but what can you do. After that, it took me a couple of years to take the plunge and go paleo. And my health was awesome then. I felt really really good and was finally able to end my 10 year battle with acne.. and then in 2018 I fell of the wagon. 

Now I'm trying to get back at it again but I'm having such a hard time getting started :( I was on day 5 today but I ended hp having rice and beans for dinner. Almost instant regret hahah I got brain fog and stomach pain almost immediately. And it's not like I didn't know it was gonna happen hahahah

Anyway. I guess I'm just looking for encouragement. Anyone else went through this? I'd be happy to read articles on why I should do paleo again, maybe they'll help me stick to it. Also, how strictly do you guys do the diet?",1547947732

Paleo,[BlogSpam] Quick 15 Minute Turmeric Cauliflower Rice!,"Cauliflower rice is a great way to get vegetables in your diet without force feeding yourself. This simple 15-minute golden cauliflower rice recipe you will be eating it by the bowl. Unlike other cauliflower rice, this one is loaded with other vegetables and spices to make a unique mixture.

For the unfamiliar, cauliflower rice is when cauliflower is cut into rice sized pieces. Then you cook it the way you want! In the case of this 15 Minute Golden Cauliflower Rice, you add a few more ingredients to make this dish more enjoyable.

The secret to a bowl of good cauliflower rice is using fresh vegetables to boost the flavor. You would also need a good head of cauliflower. Normally these are white and firm. After you’ve found the perfect head of cauliflower, cut it up and put in a food processor or blender.

If coming by fresh cauliflower is difficult, and cutting it sounds like a chore, some grocery stores carry riced cauliflower that is ready to cook. If you do get the ready to cook option, I recommend getting a brand that doesn’t put a lot of additives. Just look for a brand where the only ingredient is cauliflower.

Cauliflower is a nutrient dense food. It is rich in a variety of vitamins and minerals. These range from vitamin C to vitamin K. In addition to that, there is potassium and folate found in cauliflower. The best part of it all is that cooking cauliflower will not make any of these nutrients [go away](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793502/).

Cauliflower is indeed nutrient packed. It also has a neutral flavor which makes it excellent to enjoy with any kind of protein. It blends in pretty seamlessly. The macronutrients for this 15-minute golden cauliflower rice are the following:

* Calories: 121
* Fats: 5
* Carbs: 12
* Proteins: 7

Being low in calories makes for an excellent side to enjoy with your choice of protein. I recommend eating it within 4 days for best taste.

I hope that you enjoy!

Paleo,[Discussion] Going paleo RIGHT NOW.,"I'm just now making the possible connection between my constant allergies, asthma, and skin hives and my consumption of grains. It's like a light bulb just went off and now I'm kicking myself not thinking about this sooner.

My immune system has always been kind of a crazy bitch. Coupled with my panic/anxiety disorder, it's almost impossible to differentiate between an actual allergen and a panic attack. I take a pill that treats both allergies and symptoms of anxiety.

I cooked beef and barley soup last night. It was so delicious! Shortly after I did the dishes I began having an allergy attack. I started sneezing, wheezing, gasping for air, and my skin got very itchy. I had to take off my bra because I felt like I couldn't breathe. I took an antihistamine and used my inhaler; it took hours to fall asleep. You'd think I would have thought about a possible link between barley and my allergies, but nope.

This morning I ate leftover soup. And I had another allergy attack. I remember standing in my room, clutching my throat and thinking STOP EATING THE DAMN BARLEY YOU DUMBASS. I also made the connection between my sensitivity to beer and barley. I'm always behind the curve. =\[ 

So yeah. While I don't know if I'm sensitive to other types of grains, I'm just going to cut them out entirely for the next 30 days and eat a paleo diet (while making an appointment with an allergist). I'm interested in seeing how this pans out. I just want to be able to breathe, you know? ",1547324420

Paleo,Are cultured buttermilk and kefir paleo?,"Hello! 

I'm a big fan of fermented milk products like kefir and cultured buttermilk. I've also wanted to start eating paleo for quite some time and decided to start making the transition soon. However, there seem to be two major problems: 

\- quite a lot of people don't consider any dairy (except eggs) to be paleo,

\- commercially bought kefir and cultured buttermilk aren't exactly ""raw"", especially ones made commercially on a big scale, although the ingredients usually are limited to milk, cultures of bacteria or bacteria and yeast when it comes to kefir (I avoid ones which have, say, additional milk proteins and low-fat powdered milk used in the production process - those seem to be two of the most popular additives; I also avoid flavored ones, sticking to the natural, unsweetened kefirs and buttermilks).

Because of these two issues, I'd like to ask whether cultured buttermilk and kefir are paleo. I enjoy these drinks and they are quite common and affordable here in Poland, making them an easy to obtain and healthy breakfast food. Can I incorporate them in my new lifestyle? If not, how can I substitute them? Thanks for help :)",1547106276

Paleo,Losing weight eating Paleo [Other],"Hi everyone,

This may be a silly question &amp; apologies for wall of text. Is moving to a paleo diet/lifestyle likely to be enough to promote weight loss in itself, or does it need to be accompanied by other things like fasting, calorie counting and the like. What are others experiences? 

This sub doesn't seem to focus a lot on weight loss at all, and there was a post way down where someone was down voted heavily because they were wondering why they don't lose weight without counting calories.

I dont want to count calories, I have busy days and I reckon id get them wrong a lot too. Ultimately it's very boring. I choose paleo because I've tried it before and it is easily sustainable and healthy.

Personally I'm focusing on veges and meat, not overdoing fruit/nuts, avoiding honey and paleo-desserts. Not eating sweet potato or anything either. I generally skip breakfast anyway and have a morning snack - maybe some biltong, a big lunch, maybe some nuts or fruit in the arvo and then a quite reasonable sized dinner just veg and meat. 

I could afford to lose 20kg which is quite a bit, 5kg a year going on for 4 years while I've been slack. I understand it's not a magic diet that automatically loses you weight, just want to get a feel without counting calories, and eating a normal paleo diet if weight loss is likely to occur, how much and what others experiences have been?

Paleo,[Discussion] Here come the Weight Loss Resolutions. Can I recommend Paleo as an approach that can help people SUSTAIN THEIR WEIGHT LOSS?,"Hello r/Paleo,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a medical professional spending my personal time researching how best to help people lose weight and keep it off. I'm not interested in finding that one diet that somehow works for everyone. Instead I think some diets, or dietary approaches, work better for some people than others. I'm much more interested in understanding how sustainable/maintainable the various approaches are.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I'd like to be able to say to people “such and such approach is sustainable by a reasonable number of people, and it's worth your time to try it. Meanwhile, there are very few long-term success stories with these other approaches - try them as last resort.”

&amp;#x200B;

There's no question Paleo is effective for weight loss for some people. The real question is, is sustained weight loss with Paleo common enough? After all, what’s the use in recommending an approach if people tend to stop within a year? But I've come across arguments on this and other subs over how sustainable Paleo really is for the general population. (To be clear, I’m talking about sustained weight loss, not ecological sustainability, which I see is a common theme on this sub).

&amp;#x200B;

To see if I could get a sense from r/Paleo, I've read through a bunch of posts. Then I searched for terms like: ""weight cycling"", ""regain"", ""yo-yo"", “quit”, “sustainable”, “maintain,” etc. (I also went through the Newbie’s guide, which was terrific). Here’s what I’ve gathered. Some people find Paleo as something they can sustain over time, but I can’t tell how long they’ve been sustaining their weight loss. Some people find Paleo isn’t for them and stop. Any approach won’t fit some people – I’m not worried about that.  But I can’t tell if it’s reasonably common or easy for people to keep the weight off.

&amp;#x200B;

To get a better idea, can you help me with a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Are you a weight loss sustainer on Paleo?**

(lost at least 10% of your weight, and kept it off for at least a year) If so, what percent weight loss, and for how long?

**How difficult is it to keep that weight off with Paleo?**

(very easy, easy, moderate, difficult, very difficult)

**Who might Paleo be sustainable for?**

Does Paleo require that people possess high degree of resources (time, money), willpower, etc. to succeed? I’d like to know who I might recommend the approach to.

**What things can people do to make Paleo sustainable?** 

Certain mindset, behaviors, etc. For those who try, I’d like to help increase their chances of sustaining.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just trying to get a sense of how realistic it is. Feel free to answer open-ended. This isn't really scientific.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your help in sorting this out!",1545958648

My diet also contains lots of saturated fat like whole milk, fish, eggs etc. I read somewhere that saturated fat can be harmful when combined with a high carb diet. Should I cut my saturated fat intake for the time being? I do bodyweight training and low intensity cardio 5-6 days of the week.",1545814190

Paleo,[Question] Tips for Budget Friendly Paleo?,"Hi everyone. I have been eating mostly paleo for a while now. On occasion I will have rice because I tolerate it pretty well. I love dairy but it causes eczema, so I limit it. We do not eat beans. My husband and I are in a high COL area. We have a monthly meat share that provides grass fed/ pasture raised beef and pork. We eat organic for the dirty dozen. When we get dairy it is grass fed. We cook almost all of our meals at home. (Eat out once, maybe twice a month) our meals are fairly simple. We get a mix of fresh and frozen veggies. I have a membership to thrive market and buy pantry items there (if they are cheaper than in store). We shop mainly at Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods. I have bad luck with the produce at Aldi. I try to buy products from whichever store is cheaper. Our grocery budget is very high ~$800/ mo for the two of us (not including eating out). I’m trying to figure out how much of this is due to our COL area. We will be getting an organic veggie CSA this year to hopefully help cut cost. Any tips on how to cut cost more? Or is this reasonable for our COL? ",1545754641

Paleo,[Question] did anyone try to get rid of their glasses?,"i have taken care of several health problems when starting this diet, including chronic ear inflammation and eczema, that doctors could only cure temporarily... other small changes in my lifstyle have taken care of other things. walking barefoot more (and wearing zero drop shoes) took care of my lower back and knee pains, stopped using soap which improved my skin a bit too.

so i started thinking, assuming i was still limited to cavemen technology, what should be able to heal itself because it would get me dying otherwise: first thing i came up with was eyes, humans are sight hunters, we don't have the extremely good nose/ears of other species, so our sight is vital to be good, i looked up some things and it should be possible to restore my eyesight.

&amp;#x200B;

i found a calculator somewhere which would allow me to measure my eyes myself, and noticed my optometrist gave me glasses stronger than i actually need. (the calculator was based on the distance i see sharp, and recalculated that to a dioptre.)

&amp;#x200B;

since excercise and diet\* both seem to be important to this working i figured someone here might have tried it and could give me some direction on where to start.

\*sugar and fast carbs seem to have a negative affect on eyesight, while several minerals and vitamins have a beneficial effect",1545506221

Paleo,[BlogSpam] Paleo Friendly Chicken Satay Meal,"For the unfamiliar, Chicken Satay is enjoyed in Southeast Asia. This dish consists of chicken seasoned in a combination of spices and is eaten with a peanut sauce. Yes, peanuts and chicken sounds odd. The taste is not, however. If the peanut part concerns you, lucky for you we can make the sauce with sunflower seed butter or almond butter!

Adding the nut butter will provide you with a protein boost as well as healthy fats. All of this while also making a delicious sauce. This chicken satay meal prep is not just chicken. It has two sides; spaghetti squash and ginger bok choy. As always, you can choose your own sides!

Paleo,[Question] I am confused about potatoes...,"A few years ago I did paleo so I have knowledge about it. This last year and a half I have been low carb and I actually lost 70lbs while on keto, but keto is just really hard to maintain. Furthermore, whenever I knock myself out of ketosis I would feel terrible for a couple of days so I decided to try something more like paleo (I think its closer to the primal diet because I still eat cheese since it doesn't have a negative impact on my stomach).

Anyways, I am confused about potatoes... you often hear that sweet potato are perfectly acceptable on paleo, but white potatoes and redskin potatoes aren't allowed. I really don't understand the logic behind this; is it because sweet potatoes aren't nightshades? If we talk about nutrient content, white potatoes and red potatoes actually have near identical net carbs, when compared to sweet potatoes, but they have more protein, but less vitamin A... so why are eating potatoes bad? I know some people have problems with eating nightshades (stomach issues), but I don't experience this problem.",1545332074

Paleo,[Research] Hunter‐gatherers as models in public health,"Apologies if this post goes against rules; I've been (mostly) paleo for the last seven or eight years, although more keto/paleo recently.

I was interested to read this study: [Hunter‐gatherers as models in public health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12785#obr12785-bib-0002). It's a long read, but some interesting findings which were new to me.

It broadly supports much of what I understand to be Paleo Principles, with a few twists which may appear contrary to some of the popular dogma. i.e. meat/protein/fat may've been lower than typically suggested and carbs rather higher - including quite a lot of honey (plus bee larvae :yum:).

It seems as I think many of us know, there is no single ideal diet for all mankind - though diets that preclude all animal products are pretty much unknown, with one exception.",1545236271

Paleo,[Question] Chronic illness sufferer with AIP/Paleo questions,"Hi all. 25 y/o F that has had POTS and NDPH (constant headache/migraine) for 5.5 years. With a natural approach I have drastically reduced my POTS symptoms. Unfortunately, my headache (the worst part since day one of my illness) hasn't improved AT ALL, so I still am VERY handicapped and dependent on my family.
I believe my transition to a mostly plant based diet last year has helped a lot of things improve. However, I still know there is a LOT of room for improvement, especially with my brain fog, nausea, insomnia, depression, and obviously head pain. I consume a whole foods diet with a LOT of beans, legumes, grains, nuts and seeds, which is ONE of the healthiest diets a normal person can have, but I worry that I am preventing myself from fully healing with my current diet.
Unfortunately, I have food sensitives/allergies to some meats, and others I can't eat for other reasons. This leaves only the following meats: Bison, Beef, Turkey, and bone broth. I'd like to follow a more strict version temporarily, aka AIP, but that takes out ALL seeds and nuts too. As someone who is currently 80% plant-based, I can't imagine introducing so much meat into my system daily. My gut does not love meat in general, and I don't want to eat meat more than once a day, ideally.

*TL;DR- wanting to try Paleo but can't eat most meats, want want to eat as plant-based as possible.

Paleo,[BlogSpam] Paleo Friendly Venezuelan Christmas Roast,"While you celebrate the holidays you’re probably going to eat a lot of food and that’s okay. This Venezuelan Christmas Roast is a great addition to your holiday indulgement! The combination of seasonings, vegetables, and cooking make this pork a delicious protein.

Venezuelan Christmas Roast is unlike most common dishes that you will find in a typical American Christmas. This juicy pork is not spicy, but it packs a ton of flavor. This dish is inspired by the Venezuelan Hallaca.  Hallaca is corn dough stuffed with pork, beef, and chicken. Some recipes vary, but generally, you will find onions, peppers, olives, and raisins.

Hallacas are quite hard to make and the process to prepare is quite laborious. So, I took out the corn dough and decided to put all of the ingredients into the crockpot. I chose pork because that is what I had available. You can make this dish with chicken, beef or a combination of the three. The combinations of sweet and savory make this Christmas pork scrumptious.

This recipe does include quite a bit of vegetable. Mostly because my mom insisted on including all of the vegetables needed to make a tasty base for the meats. Among these veggies, you will find onion, leeks, and peppers. These ingredients pack a ton of vitamins and minerals. To add to that these also contain [flavonoids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12410539) and antioxidants.

The macros for this Venezuelan Christmas Roast are the following for a 4 oz serving:

Calories: 200

Fats: 10

Carbs: 4

Protein: 24

I would try to make this pork and eat within four days. Enjoy this dish with a side of plantains or your choice of vegetables.

Paleo,[Question] How do you guys meal prep?,"I'm having trouble sticking to my diet for a couple of reasons. One being that I never really learned how to cook, another that I don't know how to shop for groceries. I'll buy a bunch of produce and by the time I get around to cooking it it's gone to waste. What ends up happening is that I go out and buy lunch or dinner since I haven't cooked my food. I don't have a problem with sticking to the paleo guidelines, since I'll shop around to make sure I buy something that fits into it, but I'm wasting a ton of money and I know that ultimately cooking my own food will be healthier for me. How do you guys go about planning your meals and cooking them? Is there something I can be doing better to give my veggies better shelf life? Sorry if this question is dumb :(",1544741838

Paleo,[Recipe] Fermented Raw Beef Liver (High Liver) n=1 experiment,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMh7qqiVdAY is my inspiration. Created first batch November 29th, 2018

Recipe: 1 lb raw (local Grass-fed) beef liver (frozen at purchase) 
2 tbsp raw whey (from second ferment of Kifer made from raw milk - same farm) 
2 tsp rosemary (mom's greenhouse) 
1 egg yoke (Mom's Chickens) 
3 cloves Garic (Mom's garden) 
1/2 onion (big sweet one from Wegmens) 
1 Tsp Himalayan Salt (Amazon) 
1 Tsp peppercorns

Blended in Vitamix, scooped into brown mason jar (walmart) with plastic lid and left at room temp for 24 hours.

Tasted leftover in blender, Wasn't very palatable. (I don't have much of a gag reflex but I gagged)

After 24 hours, the taste was much MUCH more palatable! I put it in the fridge.

It bothered me that the vitamix may have aerated the liver patte, knowing that fermentation is an anaerobic process, I brainstormed how to counter this issue. I ended up ordered a Foodsaver mason jar suction lid from Amazon. The good news is it worked. The bad news is I made a mess...which didn't bother me because I ate the mess. The problem was that as the pressure decreased, the patte expanded. Fortunately, it didn't get sucked up the hose in into the machine, but it was close. It did seal, so I banged on the mason jar, releasing the expanded gas. I ended up scooping out some of the contents and mixing it up with a spoon. Several cycles of vacuuming and mixing, and the patte didn't expand anymore in a vacuum. I don't know if I improved or hurt the patte, but I have to say, I look forward to my teaspoon full every day!

Zero negative side effects to date.

And yes, my son and I have noted consistent mild mood enhancing effects on this dose. I experienced an intense mood enhancement when I ate my mess on day 6, though I didn't identify it as such at the time.

I didn't know about the mood enhancement effects until 3 days ago, though I had thought something was going on.

Kefir Whey seems to have a great ability to safely ferment all sorts of things. I have soaked apples , garlic, and asparagus, all with positive results. I am using it as a base to most of my morning smoothies as well.

Note: Mom's House is 30 min away and is a treasure trove of goodness. Warning, she guards her goodness with guns. Death toll this year = two weasels, 1 fox, and 4 woodchucks. I haven't fermented woodchuck liver, yet! I might! I know what they ate!

Safety (willing to add more): 
Do not try to ferment meat without freezing it for at least 48 hours. It kills things that should be killed. 
Do not try to ferment cooked meat. 
Don't add sugar.",1544722256

Paleo,"[Question] - I like to eat one big meal later in the day, but I want to lose 5-10 vanity pounds. Help?","Hey guys and gals. 

So I've been sticking towards paleo for around 6 years now. My daily is simple, really : 

- 2 medium boiled eggs in the morning 
- Fistful of mixed nuts during the day
- Large dinner at night when I get home from work, around 8pm. Usually a pile of vegetables and some kind of meat. Vegetables usually sauteed in avocado oil or similar, or tossed in oil and roasted. 

I'm around 5-10lbs (depending on the day) from where I feel really healthy and happy. Should I tweak this schedule? If not, which kinds of foods should I be looking towards to shave off a couple of annoying lbs? My problem is that I really like to eat a ton of food at night because of satiation. 

Because of work I don't get much of a chance for an exercise routing, but I do play ice hockey around 1-2 times a week.

Paleo,[Question] New to Paleo and Boyfriend is concerned about the amount of weight I’m losing and calories I’m consuming. Advice?,"Hi r/paleo. I am new to the sub and the SO and I are on day 22 of my first REAL Whole30 with the intention of us both going 95% paleo after. 

Today my partner and I were talking over dinner and he said he is concerned about the weight I am losing and that it *seems* like I am not eating that many calories because he almost always finished off my last few bites of dinner. 

I started my Whole30 at ~138 which is the higher end of normal for me at 5’2”. I don’t know how much I’ve lost because I’m not weighing until day 30, but admittedly almost every piece of clothes I own is loose on me. 

He said the main reason he is concerned is because I am an active mid distance runner and we have a very physically active job/home life and it seems like my calories are low. 

An example of what I eat in a day is: 

Breakfast- 2 eggs, 2 strips paleo bacon, 1 whole sweet potato, Ceremonial Matcha Almond Milk Latte. 

Lunch- Leftover Protein over a bed of salad, with fruit on the side or homemade chili or other form of soup/stew. 

Dinner- 1” thick Porkchop, with a coconut milk lime sauce, 1 cup roasted squash and huge kale salad with EVOO and white balsamic vin. 

Snack (if I run)- Fruit Salad with nuts and coconut. “monkey salad”. Sometimes a couple dates if it’s a longer run. 

Trust me guys. I’m eating, but I’m only eating until I’m full. Maybe I need to eat more carbs or something I do know? I know no one here is a doctor, but does this example seem like an adequate amount for a small active female? Is my SO worried for no reason? Or should I be eating more? ",1544498092

Paleo,[DISCUSSION] Carbophobe Needing Help,"Hi Everyone,

I recently used keto to help some fat I gained when I was recovering from surgery and couldn't lift. Keto worked great for fat loss, and I lost over 20 lbs while losing only a small amount of strength. I've recently been trying to bulk, now that I'm at my goal weight, and I'm having 2 problems:

1. Bulking on keto is kind of gross. I'm only trying to eat at a slight surplus (\~+200 cals) and it's sickening how much meat and veggies I have to eat to even have a chance at hitting my caloric intake. I love meat as much as the next guy, but eating close to 1 lb a day is not only difficult, but kind of expensive.
2. Having said that, given that I was on keto for 6 months, I'm a bit of a carbophobe now. While I'm not shredded, I definitely gained a lot more muscle definition than I ever had on keto versus other diets. Even though I love sweet potatoes, squash, fruit, potatoes, etc. I'm finding that I have this weird body dysmorphia where I feel as though if I eat any starchy food, I'll gain 5% bodyfat the next day, which is keeping me from switching.

I was wondering if there are any other lifters on this subreddit who can potentially help me overcome my fears/figure out how many carbs they typically eat. I know everyone's different, but if I could get some sense of roughly how many carbs I can eat while minimizing fat gain, based on others' ancedotes (scientific studies maybe?) that would be greatly appreciated.

In case it matters, I'm at 140 lbs right now and want to get to 150 lbs on a slow bulk. The end goal is to get to 160 at 15% bodyfat, but I figure it's better to set smaller goals first so as to avoid being discouraged.

Paleo,"[Blogspam] Comparing Keto to Carbohydrates | Energy, digestion, performance.","[Video Version](https://youtu.be/j4tpcoL12hw)

---

I decided to take some before and after photos of restored muscle glycogen, just out of curiosity. I am trailing some carbohydrate sources at the moment to see the effects. I ate some boiled potato and watermelon for a few days and have since tapered down. I ate about 70g of carbs the first few days and have since discontinued with it. About 7 days total.

I got constipation and IBS symptoms. IBS was originally resolved by going carnivore/keto. I have had some juice in the later days of the experiment to remove the fibre component and felt better.

I gained 3.5kgs/7.7lbs in 6 days, all muscle glycogen (water). I felt a little sharper mentally but that went away as I got constipated. For roughly 2 days I felt sharp and energize, 2 days I felt fatigued, bloated, constipated, then 2 days I felt fine again having juiced watermelon and ditched potato. Other than that I felt like I got a histamine type response after consuming watermelon. Puffy feeling in the eyes, blocked nose, sneeze in the sun. These things I hadn’t experienced in a while. Strength and endurance was not effected. I felt really energized the first couple of days which did boost my mood and did lead to a more ambitious workout. For now I’ll likely stick primarily to meat/fat.",1543669409

Paleo,Paleo options to help with Low blood pressure,"I have had low blood pressure for as long as I can remember. My doctor has suggested that when I start to feel dizzy I take in something fairly salty to help with it.

Prior to getting on paleo I would achieve this with saline crackers or French fries but those options are out now. What can I do instead?  It's also been suggested that I take in more b12.. Which I would think is likely happening with paleo due to increased meat and egg intake. 

I'm pretty confused as to what salty snacks are also paleo.

Immediate things that come to mind for me ase: bacon, prosciutto, salami, pickles, olives...

I know bacon is paleo approved but what about these others cured meats and brined items?

What if I'm out and det really dizzy.  Are sweet potato fries approved? 

I ask mostly because I fell getting up from the breakfast table after having a small bowl of a chili-like concoction (beef, kuri squash, bacon, chili seasonings) with a poached egg.

I have a doctor's appointment set up for next week I'm just looking for some options unti then.

Paleo,[Blogspam] Anyone else trying to quit coffee?,"So I’ve just achieved 17 days without coffee after failing numerous times in the past. I’d typically last about 48 hours before being crippled by cravings. Some people have recommended substitution, drinking tea or de-caff, but that really doesn’t solve the issue. I want to rid myself of an addiction not replace it with another. Some suggest pushing through cold-turkey, which has its place, but I have too many duties that will be significantly impacted. I decided I’d take my own approach, one I didn’t see anyone else promoting. 

**I’ve been supplementing with caffeine pills.**
-

While I would argue that at least coffee is natural, the caffeine pills are temporarily aiding me in giving up the habit. The habit consists of two components. One is the enjoyable beverage, the other is the stimulant. I’m giving up the first then the second rather than both at once, that’s why this method is proving successful. Better still, I can manage the dosage of the caffeine pill and gradually decrease my intake. I am now down to one a day (100mg). One coffee contains approximately 100mg of caffeine and I would typically drink 2-4 a day.

I am gradually quitting caffeine. This has minimized the possibility of failure, removed withdrawal and hasn’t interrupted my usual activities.

Paleo,[question] why have I been so grumpy and irritable after starting paleo,"I started paleo almost a month ago and ever since then I have been in a really bad mood. I follow paleo as much as I can. I’ll have rice cakes with vegemite for a snack sometimes because I haven’t found a good paleo alternative for my craving for chips yet. (Any suggestions please). I haven’t slept very well since I started paleo, which is probably the root of me being grumpy but I don’t usually get grumpy when I’m tired so I think it is related to me being paleo. I think it stems from me seeing my friends at school eating non paleo food and also having so much food I’m not allowed to eat at home (my mum and I are paleo, my 2 sisters and dad aren’t, so a lot of non paleo food is in the house). I know when I’ve been paleo for longer and have gotten used to it it will be easier but I have no clue why I’ve been in such a bad mood and why it’s so hard to not be able to eat non paleo food.

Paleo,[question] could i be having hypoglycemia?," 

 i try to eat about 60 carbs a day but most of the time i end up getting 70 or so. this means my first two meals are around 30 carbs and my last meal is around 10 carbs. the reason i think i am having hypoglycemia is that ive been sleeping badly and its worse on days where i workout. if i eat something, im able to sleep better. when i wake up, its on average about 5 times a night and sometimes, like last night, i wake up non stop until i go eat something. i dont really have a headache, im not sweating, and i dont even feel hungry. im still wondering if it could be a blood sugar issue. i stop eating around 8 at night and im wondering if thats too early. as if its almost like im skipping a meal and my body doesnt like it throughout the night. i plan on getting a glucometer to see if im right, but for now im really just wondering if you guys think 30g of carbs at a meal would cause me to be having hypoglycemia and if lowering my carbs more would help. i guess everyones body is different but im asking if its obvious that 30g of carbs is a bad idea during meals or should it be lower. also, is my body running off of fat right now with the amount of carbs im eating or am i burning glucose mainly? the problem i have with lowering carbs more than that is basically i cant get enough potassium in for the day if i do",1542742933

Paleo,[Question] I'm an active young female trying to gain weight on Paleo.,"How much weight by can I gain in a day by eating 36 raw eggs a day? I looked at the TDEE calculator online.

I’m supposed to be 139lbs. I can’t really make any bone broth to put some beef tallow in because I live with my family who are a vegans and they don’t want big meat pots in the house. Bad enough they don’t really want the eggs in the refrigerator but they tolerate that because fixing the eggs to drink from a glass isn’t a big hassle as boiling a long pot of broth is.

I want to gain 22 pounds in one month. I did this before when I was eating like 3,000 calories in walnut smoothies (this was WAY before I knew better) and now I know that the carbs are what made me get 22lbs so fast.

Paleo,[Question][Discussion]Seeking help/perspective to get back on the wagon (convince my spouse paleo is worth it).,"tldr; I am 32 now (lost 50 lbs when I first went paleo back in my mid 20s, went back up to 240 and am now back down to 230), wife does paleo meals occasionally for dinner, but enjoys keeping trashy food around the house and can't live without her bread/pasta foods.  Seeking help with the spouse aspect, and also some mindset help around self-control with junk food in the house, my self-control is terrible and I can gorge myself on whatever is around if I don't keep it in check.  It kills my self-image to be back up to being this heavy, and I would love to get back down in the 210 range and/or ~15% body fat.  This is obviously NOT my wife's fault, I am a big boy who is responsible for what he eats, but if I could convince her to get on board a unified front would make this lifestyle much more simplistic to stick to without all the trash distractions tempting me around every cupboard being opened.  Another possible solution could be for me to just get my head straight, rather than putting any of this on her.  Self-control, mind over matter, better mindset etc...  but being surrounded by the bad foods doesn't help and would eventually wear me down.

Background/History: 
I went paleo back in 2013ish and from the beginning my wife was never really on board stating that she couldn't live without bread, and how would she survive without ""X Y Z"" food.  She has never really had weight problems and has good control over portion control when eating junk/trash foods.  However, I on the other hand could eat handful after handful of trash food without blinking an eye.

I managed to lose about 50 lbs or so by just changing my eating habits, focusing on the weight loss (being consistent with eating habits) and only moderate exercise (lots of lifting doing 5x5 StrongLifts app).  Granted this was back in my mid 20s, so my body has changed a bit now that I am 32.  Now I am back up to around 230 (was 240 ~12 months ago but got back into regular exercise), I haven't been strict paleo for a LONG time due to lots of life changes (moving 3 times in last 2 years, new baby, wife is pregnant again and due in February 2019) also I found it just wasn't worth the stress and fighting with my wife (she likes easy foods and fast food which I know all contain chemicals and stuff that shouldn't go into your body), so I started letting all the trash and junk back into the house, of which I am the main benefactor because I work from home and take care of our 2.5 year old son which leaves us with free access to whatever we buy.  We do not eat out regularly (once a week at most budgetted ~$75/month).  We still plan meals around meat typically, but rice/pasta/bread tends to find its way to the meal along with it (when I cook I opt for brown rice, she likes white rice cause its... faster.)

The best way I know how to be paleo is simply by not allowing non paleo foods to be in the house, but my wife really just doesn't get it, and she loves me the way I am, so she doesn't think of it as a big deal.  Unfortunately a lot of my self-image is wrapped up in my weight and just being comfortable in clothes (I have really athletic/muscular thighs and carry most of my fat in my belly/thighs).  I am not going to say ""it is my wife's fault because she can't do Paleo"", because I am an adult and have to take responsibility with what I let into my body, however I am seeking some advice or strategies that others may have used that have been in a similar position or can relate to my situation.

I really enjoyed being paleo, but I find trying to be paleo while surrounded by all those comfort foods we all love (frozen pizzas, mac n cheese, pastas etc...) was just to hard for a fat kid like me.  I found that being an 80/20 primal/paleo really fit my lifestyle well because some things I still utilized (peanut butter/cheese/protein powder) on occasion, but the core concepts and the ""get away from chemicals in your foods"" really made perfect sense to me, so to this day I still read labels and pay attention to what goes into recipes.

Current positive habits:
I currently do intermittent fasting from 8pm til noon the next day which leaves me eating from about noon until 8pm each day with the strategy in mind that skipping breakfast will hopefully lower calorie count and lead towards weight loss. For exercise I currently do 35-45 minutes of cardio with light-moderate lifting 3-4 times a week.  The cardio is fairly challenging and was setup by a physical trainer at the gym I used to go to, it is designed by zones where you spend 80% in zones 1-3 and 12/8% in zones 4/5 or something along those lines, so it is fairly intense and focuses primarily on the fat burning aspects.

Those of you that read this whole thing I appreciate it and applaud you, I spent a lot more time writing this all out than I had intended to, but I wanted to give as much detail and information as possible.",1542189130

Paleo,Lebanese Lemon Chicken," INGREDIENTS

* 3 organic lemons
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1½ teaspoons flaky sea salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 12 thighs)
* 2 large shallots or 1 large onion
* 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
* 2 sprigs of fresh thyme

  INSTRUCTIONS

1. Juice one of the lemons until you have 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Put the juice in a large bowl and add the 2 tablespoons of olive oil along with the turmeric, sea salt, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
2. Add the chicken thighs to the bowl and toss to coat. Let the chicken marinate briefly at room temperature while you prepare the other ingredients.
3. Trim the ends off the other two lemons and slice them into ¼-inch thick rounds. Remove any visible seeds. Halve, peel, and slice the shallots.
4. Heat two large cast iron skillets over medium-high heat (or use one skillet and cook the chicken in two batches). Add enough olive oil to coat the bottom with a thin layer of oil.
5. Divide the chicken pieces between the two pans with the smooth side of the chicken (where the skin was) facing down, making sure to leave a little room between the pieces so they can brown. Cook for about 5 minutes, until nicely browned on the bottom, and then flip and cook for 8-10 minutes on the second side, until just cooked through, lowering the heat slightly if necessary. Use tongs or a slotted spatula to transfer the chicken pieces to a plate.
6. Add the lemons, shallots, and herb sprigs to the pans. Let cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, until the lemons are browned on the bottom. Pour ½ cup water into each pan and stir, scraping the browned bits from the bottom. Reduce the heat to medium, add the chicken back to the pans, and cook for 4-5 minutes so the flavors can meld. Serve the chicken, shallots, and pan juices hot over rice or cauliflower rice.

Paleo,[question] intermittent fasting/paleo/ and sleep," 

ive been practicing 'time restricted eating' which just means stopping eating at 8pm and not eating again until getting up in the morning. i just havent had good sleep for a while now and im wondering if im waking up from low blood glucose. i eat around 100g of carbs per day, no refined sugar, gluten etc. just whole foods really. sometimes i wake up to what feels like a low heart rate. sometimes i wake up and it feels like my pulse/blood pressure is high (i sleep with ear plugs and can feel my pulse in my neck easier as a result). sometimes it feels like my heart beats a bit faster when i wake up. sometimes im able to go back to sleep relatively quickly and sometimes it takes a bit. sometimes im still sleepy when i wake up, other times it feels like im alert. do any of these symptoms ring a bell? are there any symptoms i should look for if this were happening to me? im planning on getting a glucose monitor to check my levels during the night but id like to see if anyone who is also fasting and on a paleo diet may have the same symptoms",1542144774

According to [skeptoid.com](https://skeptoid.com)'s [article/podcast](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4623) the EWG's dirty dozen list is essentially anti-science propaganda who's main agenda is to lobby for organic produce and he references The American Council on Science and other Science based organizations that support this view however there is zero acknowledgement that strawberries, apples or any of these top 10 foods induce this odd immune response that is actually pretty common based off conversations I've had with friends and family as well as my own experience and skeptoid's author and references all seem to share the consensus that these foods are completely safe yet we know nothing about it's impact on our epigenome or our microbiome. Also I don't ever get these negative side effects after consuming organic apples and strawberries, why is that?

Paleo,[BlogSpam] Paleo Elk Burgers!,"Recipe Link: https://realricofitness.com/1-4-pound-elk-burgers-paleo-keto/

For the unfamiliar, elk is an animal related to deer. They look quite similar except that they are larger, some weighing over 700 lbs (300 kg). Normally people get their elk by hunting it. I did not kill an elk in order to make 1/4 pound elk burgers. Hunting is a skill I am currently learning, however.  The 1/4 pound elk burgers came about when my wife and I found the ground elk at a supermarket in Asheville, North Carolina.

We were a bit nervous at first, we didn’t know to make elk. Never even had it before. To tackle it was decided to turn the ground elk into juicy hamburger patties. It is common knowledge, among people that eat game, that game meat can be dry.

I decided to mix the elk with some uncured bacon. This would give it a little moisture and add that bacon flavor. We cooked it on a low heat and covered to let all the flavors develop.

Elk meat is an excellent source of protein. Loaded with protein as well as a ton of healthy fats. If you follow paleo, eating game is probably the way to go. It is a far cleaner and more nutrient dense meat.

The macros for the 1/4 pound elk burgers are the following:

Calories: 330
Fats: 20
Carbs: 0
Protein: 28",1541856253

For example in the morning I have two cups of spinach blended with 1/2 cup fresh orange juice and 1/4 cup unsalted sunflower seeds. For lunch 3 oz beef and veggies. For dinner 3 oz chicken and veggies. Sometimes I snack veggies between meals and for dessert will have some berries (blue or rasp).

Paleo,[Question] Question about daily meal plan from a newbie,"So I've never been one to do much more than simply count calories, but after doing a lot of reading on how paleo not only helps with fat loss but also overall mind and body changes, I want to give it a real shot. 

I know this may sound like an excuse, but I'm quite busy most of the day between traveling to work and my 2 kids, and I don't have a lot of money to spend a ton on groceries, but I came up with a daily plan earlier and was looking for some feedback. I know that whey protein is frowned upon somewhat on a paleo diet but the convenience of a protein shake offers too much value to me to give them up. Anyways...

Breakfast: 3 hard boiled eggs with black coffee

Snack: 1 serving Blue Diamond Habanero BBQ almonds, protein shake (1.5 servings unsweetened vanilla almond milk with 1 scoop Body Fortress chocolate whey protein)

Lunch: Lettuce wrap with 1 can tuna and 1/2 avocado, Quest Bar (blueberry muffin)

Snack: Protein shake (same as above)

Dinner: Great Value frozen skinless chicken with 1/2 avocado, 1 bag frozen broccoli and cauliflower, 1 hard boiled egg

Snack: Fage Greek yogurt

Totals come out to 1850 calories, 82g carbs, 87g fat, and 190g protein

I know this doesn't look strictly paleo, but would this type of meal plan still reap the benefits seen in a Paleo diet? I'm quite new to this and trying to keep it as cheap as I can.

Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!",1541175503

Paleo,[Question] Can anyone help me with my Paleo meal plan?,"Hey r/Paleo users!

I have been researching diets these past few weeks and have decided to go with the Paleo diet. It makes the most sense to me as I am currently a dental student trying to avoid processed foods, sugar and most of all getting fit on top of it.

If you can’t hunt it or grow it, then you can’t eat it, right?
