    "Lifestyle Eating is out to help people live healthier and happier lives through their diets. The idea is to build a platform that fosters a supportive community of users for a variety of diets. Within each diet community, they’ll be able to ask questions, share recipes and provide personal updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the option to simply have the user fill this information out when they post exists, the product development team is interested in rolling it out with auto-classification technology that can detect what diet the user is on, as they think this is something that could come in handy in later platform features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how viable this auto-classification technology will be when applied to user posts, they've requested for us, the data science team, to look into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As lead data scientist on phase 1 of Project Auto-Classify, I’ve chosen to pull submissions from the [PlantBasedDiet](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/) and [Paleo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/) subreddits, as the submissions are very similar to what users would post on the Lifestyle Eating platform. These two diets were chosen because while they have a major difference, they share many similarities that will make the project a moderately challenging one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of phase 1 will be to identify the classification model that will most accurately detect the diets of the submissions. The model will be evaluated through the accuracy scores of the training and testing datasets. The results and findings of this phase will serve as the building blocks for the remainder of the project’s phases.\n",

    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the plant-based and paleo diets were chosen because while they have major differences, they share many similarities. So, what exactly do they consist of?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **whole-food, plant-based diet** is one that focuses on natural foods that come from plants, are not heavily processed (minimally refined) and are free of animal ingredients such as meat, dairy, eggs and honey. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main food groups for this diet are fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. Additional acceptable foods include nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh, and plant-based milks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **paleolithic diet**, commonly referred to as the caveman diet, focuses on natural foods that were consumed before the Neolithic or Agricultural Revolution (10,000 B.C.) when farming became the primary method of obtaining food.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main food groups for this diet are lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables and nuts. They avoid all processed foods, dairy, grains, legumes, and carbs that don’t come from fruits or vegetables.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the similarities lie in that they focus on natural foods like fruits, vegetables and nuts, while avoiding processed foods and dairy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences lie in that a paleo diet allows meat and fish, and avoids grains and legumes. The plant-based diet allows grains and legumes, but does not allow meat and fish.\n",

    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The subreddit submissions will be obtained through the Pushift API. Given that the API limits to pulling 100 submissions at a time, a function will be created in order to automate the pulling of the desired number of submissions and return a concatenated DataFrame for a given subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, there will be two CSV files created, one for the PlantBasedDiet subreddit and one for the Paleo subreddit. Each will contain the 5,000 most recent submissions, and include the following features: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **subreddit** - name of the subreddit the submission belonged to\n",
    "* **title** - title of the submission\n",
    "* **selftext** - body text of the submission\n",
